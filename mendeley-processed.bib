Through wavelet analysis, transients are decomposed into a series of wavelet components, each of which is a time-domain signal that covers a specific octave frequency band. This paper presents the basic ideas of discrete wavelet analysis.

  abstract                 = {Change-point models are generative models of time-varying data in which the underlying generative parameters undergo discontinuous changes at different points in time known as change points. Change-points often represent important events in the underlying processes, like a change in brain state reflected in EEG data or a change in the value of a company reflected in its stock price. However, change-points can be difficult to identify in noisy data streams. Previous attempts to identify change-points online using Bayesian inference relied on specifying in advance the rate at which they occur, called the hazard rate (h). This approach leads to predictions that can depend strongly on the choice of h and is unable to deal optimally with systems in which h is not constant in time. In this letter, we overcome these limitations by developing a hierarchical extension to earlier models. This approach allows h itself to be inferred from the data, which in turn helps to identify when change-points occur. We show that our approach can effectively identify change-points in both toy and real data sets with complex hazard rates and how it can be used as an ideal-observer model for human and animal behavior when faced with rapidly changing inputs.},

Despite only minimal interest at this time by the federal government in behavioral approaches to energy conservation, there are now many reports demonstrating the application of psychologically based procedures to conserve energy in buildings. Methods that reward energy conservation in a number of ways have yielded meaningful short-run reductions. Extensions of current strategies and other procedures derived from a framework presented in the paper may eventually result in more pervasive, longer-term savings. In the light of that objective, the paper also outlines a number of micro- and macro-level projects, some involving the meshing of behavioral and physical technology, that can be readily conducted in residential and commercial buildings.</p>}

Contextually supervised source separation is a natural fit for domains with large amounts of data but no explicit supervision; our motivating application is energy disaggregation of hourly smart meter data (the separation of whole-home power signals into different energy uses). Here we apply contextual supervision to disaggregate the energy usage of thousands homes over four years, a significantly larger scale than previously published efforts, and demonstrate on synthetic data that our method outperforms the unsupervised approach.},

Load recognition for identifying loads being connected and disconnected is applied to a NILM by using a neural network, especially for industrial electrical loads, even though some loads are activated at the nearly same time. In order to accurately decompose the aggregate load into its components, a feature-based model for describing the signatures of individual appliances and load combinations is used. The model will suggest the certain signatures which can be detected for all loads in order to indicate the activities of the separate components. To verify the performance of the model for the features selection, the data sets of the electrical loads and the load recognition techniques apply an electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and a neural network, respectively. The effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition are analyzed and compared by using the back propagation classifier and the learning vector quantization classifier. To obtain a maximum recognition accuracy rate, the calculation of the turn-on transient energy signature employs a window of samples, At, to adaptively segment a transient representative of a class of loads. Experiments performed with a variety of model data sets which reveal the back propagation classifier is superior to the learning quantization classifier in the effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition.}

This paper explores how to support energy as a first-class operating system resource. Energy, because of its global system nature, presents challenges beyond those of conventional resource management. To meet these challenges we propose the Currentcy Model that unifies energy accounting over diverse hardware components and enables fair allocation of available energy among applications. Our particular goal is to extend battery lifetime by limiting the average discharge rate and to share this limited resource among competing task according to user preferences. To demonstrate how our framework supports explicit control over the battery resource we implemented ECOSystem, a modified Linux, that incorporates our currentcy model. Experimental results show that ECOSystem accurately accounts for the energy consumed by asynchronous device operation, can achieve a target battery lifetime, and proportionally shares the limited energy resource among competing tasks.}

  abstract                 = {Appliance Load Monitoring (ALM) is essential for energy management solutions, allowing them to obtain appliance-specific energy consumption statistics that can further be used to devise load scheduling strategies for optimal energy utilization. Fine-grained energy monitoring can be achieved by deploying smart power outlets on every device of interest; however it incurs extra hardware cost and installation complexity. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an attractive method for energy disaggregation, as it can discern devices from the aggregated data acquired from a single point of measurement. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of NILM system and its associated methods and techniques used for disaggregated energy sensing. We review the state-of-the art load signatures and disaggregation algorithms used for appliance recognition and highlight challenges and future research directions.},

Based on the proposed disaggregation framework, we use three advanced disaggregation algorithms, called committee decision mechanisms (CDMs), to perform load disaggregation at the metering level. Three random switching simulators are also developed to investigate the performance of different CDMs under a variety of scenarios. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that all CDMs outperform any single-feature, single-algorithm-based disaggregation methods. With sensitivity analysis, we also show that the CDMs are less sensitive to any load dynamics and noise. We finally demonstrate some applications of this technology in terms of appliance usage tacking and estimated energy consumption of each appliance.}

  abstract                 = {A computer programme which aims to cut power wastage in low-income households has been launched after a trial in five east London boroughs.

The Shimmer system assesses a home's electricity consumption and recommends ways to make it more efficient, the Energy Saving Trust said.

It also connects to an online accounting tool to encourage budgeting.

The project could "help a lot of people in future", said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice.

Last week an independent report found thousands of people die each year from illnesses linked to fuel poverty.

Shimmer works by connecting electrical appliances to "smart" plugs which measure the amount of power used and provide an itemised bill showing how much each item costs to run.

The programme then suggests how to cut costs, for instance by recommending more efficient boilers or fridges, and lists appropriate benefits and allowances available to the user.
'Smart homes'

A total of 18 homes, most of which were in debt and had little disposable income, tried the system in Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge and Waltham Forest.

The savings for each ran into hundreds of pounds a year, the trust said.

"Ultimately, we need to have smart homes, not just smart meters," said chief executive Philip Sellwood.

Citizens Advice said increasing numbers of people were seeking information on cutting fuel bills and saving energy.

"Around Â£18bn of means-tested benefits and tax credits is unclaimed this year and this project shows that some of the biggest 'savings' for households came as a result of advice on financial issues and benefit entitlements people either did not know about, or did not think were for them," said Ms Guy.

"Combining that advice with new technology which puts customers in control of their energy usage could be a powerful combination to help a lot of people in future."}

  abstract                 = {Brussels, 17th February 2012 â Citizens and business often waste energy because they do not realise which appliances and lighting use the most energy. An EU-funded project tested in the United Kingdom and Bulgaria is helping to change that â showing consumers reduced energy usage by an average of 8{\%} when provided with an "information dashboard" about their energy use.

The Digital Environment Home Energy Management System (DEHEMS) project shows that when a consumer receives more information about their energy use, and can share and compare this with neighbours and family, they are more likely to change their behaviour. The EU-funded system presents data every 6 seconds through a small digital display. The data can also be displayed in real time via a TV screen, mobile phone, PC or social media app.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes said: "People make better choices when they have better information at hand. The DEHEMS project shows that very simple technologies can go a long way to helping Europe reduce energy use."

The DEHEMS system could set a huge trend in the coming years. Two commercial products are now available: The "Energyhive" (www.energyhive.co.uk) and its network that enables members to get a real time view of their home energy consumption 24/7 through a web browser and "Greenica" (www.greenica.net) which offers special products for homes, schools and small businesses. Thanks to a partnership between Hildebrand and IBM, the DEHEMS project and its lessons will soon be used by businesses both in Europe and worldwide. Major deployment is foreseen with Smart Grids Australia (involving 50,000 homes) and a district heating initiative in Camden, London. Last but not least, the Family House Association in Birmingham is looking to use DEHEMS-type technology thanks to the results achieved so far.}
