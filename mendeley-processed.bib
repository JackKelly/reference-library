 abstract = {Load signatures embedded in common electricity consumption patterns, in fact, could render much information pertaining to the nature of the appliances and their usage patterns. Based on the proposed disaggregation framework, we use three advanced disaggregation algorithms, called committee decision mechanisms (CDMs), to perform load disaggregation at the metering level. Three random switching simulators are also developed to investigate the performance of different CDMs under a variety of scenarios. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that all CDMs outperform any single-feature, single-algorithm-based disaggregation methods. With sensitivity analysis, we also show that the CDMs are less sensitive to any load dynamics and noise. We finally demonstrate some applications of this technology in terms of appliance usage tacking and estimated energy consumption of each appliance.},

 abstract = {A computer programme which aims to cut power wastage in low-income households has been launched after a trial in five east London boroughs.

The Shimmer system assesses a home's electricity consumption and recommends ways to make it more efficient, the Energy Saving Trust said.

It also connects to an online accounting tool to encourage budgeting.

The project could "help a lot of people in future", said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice.

Last week an independent report found thousands of people die each year from illnesses linked to fuel poverty.

Shimmer works by connecting electrical appliances to "smart" plugs which measure the amount of power used and provide an itemised bill showing how much each item costs to run.

The programme then suggests how to cut costs, for instance by recommending more efficient boilers or fridges, and lists appropriate benefits and allowances available to the user.
'Smart homes'

A total of 18 homes, most of which were in debt and had little disposable income, tried the system in Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge and Waltham Forest.

The savings for each ran into hundreds of pounds a year, the trust said.

"Ultimately, we need to have smart homes, not just smart meters," said chief executive Philip Sellwood.

Citizens Advice said increasing numbers of people were seeking information on cutting fuel bills and saving energy.

"Around Â£18bn of means-tested benefits and tax credits is unclaimed this year and this project shows that some of the biggest 'savings' for households came as a result of advice on financial issues and benefit entitlements people either did not know about, or did not think were for them," said Ms Guy.

"Combining that advice with new technology which puts customers in control of their energy usage could be a powerful combination to help a lot of people in future."},

 abstract = {Brussels, 17th February 2012 â Citizens and business often waste energy because they do not realise which appliances and lighting use the most energy. An EU-funded project tested in the United Kingdom and Bulgaria is helping to change that â showing consumers reduced energy usage by an average of 8{\%} when provided with an "information dashboard" about their energy use.

The Digital Environment Home Energy Management System (DEHEMS) project shows that when a consumer receives more information about their energy use, and can share and compare this with neighbours and family, they are more likely to change their behaviour. The EU-funded system presents data every 6 seconds through a small digital display. The data can also be displayed in real time via a TV screen, mobile phone, PC or social media app.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes said: "People make better choices when they have better information at hand. The DEHEMS project shows that very simple technologies can go a long way to helping Europe reduce energy use."

The DEHEMS system could set a huge trend in the coming years. Two commercial products are now available: The "Energyhive" (www.energyhive.co.uk) and its network that enables members to get a real time view of their home energy consumption 24/7 through a web browser and "Greenica" (www.greenica.net) which offers special products for homes, schools and small businesses. Thanks to a partnership between Hildebrand and IBM, the DEHEMS project and its lessons will soon be used by businesses both in Europe and worldwide. Major deployment is foreseen with Smart Grids Australia (involving 50,000 homes) and a district heating initiative in Camden, London. Last but not least, the Family House Association in Birmingham is looking to use DEHEMS-type technology thanks to the results achieved so far.},

 abstract = {Modelling power systems is an area of ongoing interest in the transmission management and control systems community. Continuing development is driven by two forces. The traditional tasks of model maintenance and management must be achieved with fewer resources. At the same time, model exchange and coordination has become a priority. The latter force arises from the disaggregation of utility functions and the introduction of power markets. This paper begins by identifying some of the power system modelling tasks that have become important, but are ill served by current tools and techniques. Among these are model versioning and version control, migration of models between, different schema, the transformation of models for different purposes or applications, and the merging of models from different sources. These tasks are typically handled by semi-manual methods or heavily customized software. The paper then describes the application of knowledge representation to power system modelling. In particular, the power of this approach to provide generic solutions to the, foregoing problems is explored. Knowledge representation is contrasted with more common data representations and put into context with current industry initiatives, EPRI CIM (common information model), UMS DAF (data access facility) and XML/CIM. Finally, the feasibility of using knowledge representation for power system models is illustrated with a case study from a major Australian distribution utility},

 abstract = {The forced swimming test of rats or mice is a frequently used behavioral test to evaluate compounds for antidepressant activity in vivo. The aim of this study was to replace the human observer, needed to score and analyze the behavior of animals, by a fully automated method. For this purpose, in a first step from a video recording of each rat, an activity profile was calculated, from which subsequently a set of meaningful properties was extracted. This set was finally used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Furthermore, specialized kernel functions, namely the so-called time resolved p-spectrum and modified optimal assignment kernels, were developed to calculate the similarity of activity profiles. Our method allows for a very reliable discrimination of animals treated with antidepressants of different classes (tricyclics imipramine and desipramine as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SSRI, fluoxetine) versus a vehicle-treated group. Moreover, our technique is able to classify between tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs. The results of this work enabled the development of an automated and highly accurate behavior classification system.},

Of particular appeal is the fact that our solution is not application-specific, and offers power-savings for a very generic data center model. In this paper, we describe our solution, identify the parameters that determine its cost-benefit tradeoffs, and present a simulator that allows us to explore this parameter space.

 abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be one of the most widely used tools for learning probabilistic models of time series data. In an HMM, information about the past is conveyed through a single discrete variableâthe hidden state. We discuss a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations, and relate it to the forwardâbackward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods. Within the variational framework, we present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for learning the parameters of the model. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that factorial HMMs can capture statistical structure in this data set which an unconstrained HMM cannot.},

Warming is larger in the Western Equatorial Pacific than in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific over the past century, and we suggest that the increased WestâEast temperature gradient may have increased the likelihood of strong El Ni{\~{n}}os, such as those of 1983 and 1998. Comparison of measured sea surface temperatures in the Western Pacific with paleoclimate data suggests that this critical ocean region, and probably the planet as a whole, is approximately as warm now as at the Holocene maximum and within â1Â°C of the maximum temperature of the past million years.

 abstract = {A new channel model and channel inversion algorithm are presented for correcting symbol sequences that have been corrupted by an unknown combination of known fault mechanisms. The algorithm is similar to the Viterbi algorithm in that it is suitable for situations in which the uncorrupted data string is generated by a known finite-state process, but it is more versatile in that it can correct a much broader class of errors. Of particular importance is the fact that the algorithm corrects common context-sensitive errors, such as symbol changes, transpositions, mergers, splits, insertions, and deletions, which may be assigned different probabilities depending on the context of preceeding and subsequent symbols. As many communication channels can be modeled in this way, this algorithm is a significant extension over the Viterbi algorithm and previous decoding techniques. The notion of channel rules is introduced to provide a framework for the user to specify the channel operation. The algorithm is given in both an off-line form and a recursive form suitable for sequentially presented data streams. In most applications, the recursive form has computational complexity only a constant times that of the Viterbi algorithm},

The first stage divides the consumption in two parts: weather- and illumination-related, and residual consumption, where weather-related consumption refers to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). Given the hourly total consumption, we obtain the hourly weather-related and illumination-related electricity consumption, and subtract this out to get residual consumption. The second stage of the model is a flexible, agent-based analytical tool that allows disaggregation of residual consumption into a sum of consumptions by different groups of appliances. This tool can be used for a variety of applications including an optimization of demand-side management and/or a development of a set of desirable patterns for schedules of electricity-related activities in households (within an acceptable range of course) in order to minimize negative effects of high peak demand.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes to compare the performance of neural network classifiers between back propagation (BP) and learning vector quantization (LVQ) for pattern analyses of features selection in a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) system. Load recognition for identifying loads being connected and disconnected is applied to a NILM by using a neural network, especially for industrial electrical loads, even though some loads are activated at the nearly same time. In order to accurately decompose the aggregate load into its components, a feature-based model for describing the signatures of individual appliances and load combinations is used. The model will suggest the certain signatures which can be detected for all loads in order to indicate the activities of the separate components. To verify the performance of the model for the features selection, the data sets of the electrical loads and the load recognition techniques apply an electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and a neural network, respectively. The effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition are analyzed and compared by using the back propagation classifier and the learning vector quantization classifier. To obtain a maximum recognition accuracy rate, the calculation of the turn-on transient energy signature employs a window of samples, At, to adaptively segment a transient representative of a class of loads. Experiments performed with a variety of model data sets which reveal the back propagation classifier is superior to the learning quantization classifier in the effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition.},

 abstract = {In response to growing concerns over climate change and rising energy costs, a number of eco-feedback systems are being tested by researchers. Yet, the interface design aspect of these systems has largely been ignored. Therefore, the role that interface design plays at the component level in driving actual energy savings from users is unclear. In this paper, we evaluate the impact interface design has on eco-feedback performance by investigating five established design components. We conducted a six week empirical study with 43 participants using a prototype eco-feedback interface. Analysis of usage data affirmed a statistically significant inverse correlation between user engagement (measured as logins) and energy consumption. Utilizing this relationship as a basis for performance, we expanded our analysis to evaluate the five design components. The study revealed statistically significant evidence corroborating that historical comparison and incentives are design components that drive higher engagement and thus reductions in energy consumption. Results for the normative comparison and disaggregation components were inconclusive, while results for the rewards and penalization component suggest that a revision to the penalization aspect of the component may be necessary. This study raises pertinent questions regarding the efficacy of various eco-feedback components in eliciting energy savings.},

It is demonstrated that either a three-state ESHMM or a standard HMM with an increased number of states is capable of closely matching both Gamma distributions and duration distributions of phonemes from the TIMIT corpus, as measured by Bhattacharyya distance to the true distributions. Standard HMMs are easily implemented with off-the-shelf tools, whereas duration models require substantial algorithmic development and have higher computational costs when implemented, suggesting that a simple adjustment to HMM topologies is perhaps a more efficient solution to the problem of duration than more complex approaches.},

 abstract = {There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the ubiquitous Hidden Markov Model for learning from sequential and time-series data. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi-Markovianity, which has been developed mainly in the parametric frequentist setting, to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicit-duration Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden semi-Markov Model (HDP-HSMM) and develop sampling algorithms for efficient posterior inference. The methods we introduce also provide new methods for sampling inference in the finite Bayesian HSMM and the HDP-HMM. Our modular Gibbs sampling methods can be embedded in samplers for larger hierarchical Bayesian models, adding semi-Markov chain modeling as another tool in the Bayesian inference toolbox. We demonstrate the utility of the HDP-HSMM and our inference methods on both synthetic and real experiments.},

 abstract = {We propose a method to examine structural and behavioral determinants of residential electricity consumption, by developing separate models for daily maximum (peak) and minimum (idle) consumption. We apply our method on a data set of 1628 households' electricity consumption. The results show that weather, location and floor area are among the most important determinants of residential electricity consumption. In addition to these variables, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption, as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19 and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level, home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption.},

 abstract = {Wise management of electricity consumption is becoming increasingly important. Domestic electricity prices in the UK increased by 35 {\%} over the past 8 years; an upward trend which is unlikely to reverse any time soon. As well as the economic costs, the environmental problems associated with the combustion of fossil fuels are becoming increasingly detrimental to the well-being of many species, including our own. One of the cheapest and easiest ways to improve energy efficiency is to monitor one's electricity consumption using a type of smart meter called a âhome energy monitorâ available for around Â£40. These display whole-house consumption in real-time, allowing the user to learn which devices and behaviours consume the most energy. Studies have demonstrated that the feedback provided by energy monitors can enable users to reduce consumption by 5-15 {\%}. If every domestic user in the UK reduced electricity consumption by 10 {\%} then the UK's annual CO2 output would be reduced by 6 million tonnes. However, the information displayed by home energy monitors is not as useful as it could be. Home energy monitors measure aggregate consumption for an entire building. Research has demonstrated that disaggregated information describing appliance-by-appliance energy consumption is more effective than aggregate information. Disaggregation was first successfully implemented in the 1980s using sophisticated smart meters which provide rich, multi-dimensional raw sensor data. However, these sophisticated meters are not readily available at present. The main contribution of this project is to design, implement and evaluate three different algorithms for disaggregating the sparse, one-dimensional data output by inexpensive, popular and readily available home energy monitors. Each design is trained to recognise a device on the basis of one or more raw recordings of single-device power consumption (which we call signatures). The system is then given an unseen aggregate signal from which it must infer the start times, run duration and energy consumption of each device activation present in the aggregate data. The first design is a simple prototype which uses a least mean squares approach to matching a signature to an aggregate signal. As expected, this design succeeds only in a very limited set of contexts but the development of this prototype provided valuable insights. The second design represents a novel approach to determining a set of device power states by identifying peaks in the histogram of the device's signature but this design proved to not be ideal. The final design presented in this dissertation represents a novel approach to disaggregation whereby each device is modelled as a power state graph. Each graph vertex (node) represents a power state and each edge represents the conditions necessary to transition from the source to the destination power state. During disaggregation, every possible âfitâ of the power state graph to the aggregate data is represented as a tree structure where each tree vertex represents a power state and each tree edge represents the likelihood for the corresponding power state transition. For each complete âfitâ of the power state graph to the aggregate data, the disaggregation algorithm reports the start time, the average likelihood, the estimated run time and the estimated total energy consumption. This design has several attractive features: 1) it handles both simple devices and complex devices whose signatures contain power state sequences which repeat an arbitrary number of times; 2) it is probabilistic; 3) a power state graph can be learnt from one or more signatures and 4) the design estimates the energy consumed by each device activation. This design was evaluated by training it to recognise four real devices: a toaster, a kettle, a washing machine and a tumble drier. The system was then given 13 days of real aggregate data. For all devices except the tumble drier it detected every device activation in the aggregate data although there were a few false positives. The system failed to model the tumble drier, possibly because the drier has very rapid state transitions.},

 abstract = {Consumers use simplified measurements as a basis for residential energy decisions. We analyze their measurements of monthly consumption, changes through time, comparison of appliances, and length of payback period. Because of systematic errors in quantification, consumers choose ineffective energy conservation actions, and underestimate the benefits of previous actions. These errors do not result solely from lack of information since they are made even by consumers who understand technical energymeasurement. To explain the persistence of a seemingly disadvantageous system, we show that consumer methods are cognitively efficient. They are easy to learn and use and are compatible with general-purpose budgeting tasks. However, they lead to higher energy use than would be economically optimal for either the individual or the nation.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of detecting multiple changepoints in large data sets. Our focus is on applications where the number of changepoints will increase as we collect more data: for example in genetics as we analyse larger regions of the genome, or in finance as we observe time-series over longer periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimising a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalised likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favourably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies we show that our new method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative exact methods. We also compare with the Binary Segmentation algorithm for identifying changepoints, showing that the exactness of our approach can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the data.},

 abstract = {This paper considers additive factorial hidden Markov models, an extension to HMMs where the state factors into multiple independent chains, and the output is an additive function of all the hidden states. Although such models are very powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly susceptible to local optima. In this paper we propose an alternative inference method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a "robust" mixture component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time. Combining these elements we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing approaches in practice. The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate signal.},

Data-mining algorithms capture the relationships among the power output, power factor, and controllable and non-controllable variables of a 1.5Â MW wind turbine. An evolutionary strategy algorithm solves the data-derived optimization model and determines optimal control settings. Computational experience has demonstrated opportunities to improve the power factor and the power output by optimizing set points of blade pitch angle and generator torque. It is shown that the pitch angle and the generator torque can be controlled to maximize the energy capture from the wind and enhance the quality of the power produced by the wind turbine with a DFIG generator. These improvements are in the presence of reactive power remedies used in modern wind turbines.

Load signatures can be applied to produce many useful services and products, such as, determining the energy usage of individual appliances, monitoring the health of critical equipment, monitoring power quality, and developing facility management tools. Load signatures of typical yet extensive loads are needed to be collected before applying them to different services and products. As there are an enormous number of electrical appliances, it is beneficial to classify the appliances for building a well-organized load signature database. The objective of this study is to develop an effective method to classify the loads. A 2-dimensional form of load signatures, voltage-current (V-l) trajectory, is suggested for characterizing the typical household appliances.Hierarchical clustering method was employed to classify the appliances and construct the taxonomy of the appliances. The taxonomy based on V-l trajectory was compared to the taxonomies based on traditional power metrics and eigenvectors in the previous studies. It was found that the groups of appliances in the taxonomy based on V-I trajectory were well-separated and had engineering meanings .},

Of course, powering down servers naively will render data stored only on powered down servers inaccessible. While data replication can be exploited to power down servers without losing access to data, unfortunately, care must be taken in the design of the replication and server power down schemes to avoid creating load imbalances on the remaining "live" servers.

 abstract = {The biggest change in the TPC benchmarks in over two decades is now well underway â namely
the addition of an energy efficiency metric along with traditional performance metrics. This change
is fueled by the growing, real, and urgent demand for energy-efficient database processing. Database
query processing engines must now consider becoming energy-aware, else they risk missing many op-
portunities for significant energy savings. While other recent work has focused on solely optimizing for
energy efficiency, we recognize that such methods are only practical if they also consider performance
requirements specified in SLAs. The focus of this paper is on the design and evaluation of a general
framework for query optimization that considers both performance constraints and energy consumption
as first-class optimization criteria. Our method recognizes and exploits the evolution of modern comput-
ing hardware that allows hardware components to operate in different energy and performance states.
Our optimization framework considers these states and uses an energy consumption model for database
query operations. We have also built a model for an actual commercial DBMS. Using our model the
query optimizer can pick query plans that meet traditional performance goals (e.g., specified by SLAs), but result in lower energy consumption. Our experimental evaluations show that our system-wide en-

It has a low installation cost and high reliability because it uses a bare minimum of sensors. It is possible to use modem state and parameter estimation algorithms to verify remotely the "health" of electromechanical loads by using NILM to analyze measured waveforms associated with the operation of individual loads. NILM can also monitor the operation of the electrical distribution system itself, identifying situations where two or more otherwise healthy loads interfere with each other's operation through voltage waveform distortion or power quality problems. Strategies for nonintrusive monitoring have developed over the last 20 years. Advances in computing technology make a new wealth of computational tools useful in practical, field-based NILM systems.

 abstract = {Obtaining high quality information economically and reliably is always a difficult objective to achieve. The electric power industry and consumers recently face many challenges, such as deregulation, autonomous power systems and power quality. The knowledge of the nature and state of the power systems will undoubtedly be the key in meeting these challenges. The Non-Intrusive Power Monitor is a novel attempt to collect such information with a minimal physical installation. Raw voltage and current are measured at a single location to yield harmonic power signals. They typically carry the fingerprints of the electric loads present in a system, and their analysis can produce such information as the operational and diagnostic status of the loads. The power signals can also be used for the system identification, parameter estimation and energy consumption optimization study. In this research, the power signals are mostly modeled as stochastic processes and various detection, estimation and pattern recognition algorithms are developed to extract desired information. A constant load status identifier is developed in this thesis which can identify the ON and OFF status of electric loads, both from their steady-state power consumptions and transient patterns. The identifier can also classify multiple load events occurring at a same time and estimate states without load events. The power consumed by a variable speed drive is also estimated using the correlations between the fundamental powers and higher harmonic powers. The harmonic signal generated by the imbalance of a rotating machine is estimated to monitor the drive, i.e. its speed and magnitude of the imbalance. The algorithms are thoroughly tested using the data collected at real buildings, and some of them are implemented on-line.},

 abstract = {Knowledge of electric load signatures is the foundation of practical technologies for load monitoring, which involves the
identification of an electric appliance and the determination of its operating state. Such knowledge can provide benefits to utilities, customers, appliance manufacturers and other stakeholders. Many approaches can help to understand the load characteristics of
electrical appliances and equipment. This research focuses on the two core components of these approaches: (1) methods to
measure and represent load characteristics, and (2) the development of signal processing techniques and estimation algorithms for
signal filtering, signal disaggregation and load recognition. This paper presents the methodology and observations of the load
signatures in their operation modes. The current and voltage of typical appliances are measured, and characteristics of the
waveform signatures so obtained are analyzed. By studying the collected data, it is planned to develop an algorithm that can
provide a basis of a taxonomy of electrical loads and an archive for stakeholdersâ reference.},

Different strategies and approaches for NILM systems have been developed over the past thirty years. This paper reviews the current state of the algorithms and systems of NILM.

By comparing the altitudinal distribution of 171 forest plant species between 1905 and 1985 and 1986 and 2005 along the entire elevation range (0 to 2600 meters above sea level) in west Europe, we show that climate warming has resulted in a significant upward shift in species optimum elevation averaging 29 meters per decade. The shift is larger for species restricted to mountain habitats and for grassy species, which are characterized by faster population turnover. Our study shows that climate change affects the spatial core of the distributional range of plant species, in addition to their distributional margins, as previously reported.},

 abstract = {Elasticity - where systems acquire and release resources in response to dynamic workloads, while paying only for what they need - is a driving property of cloud computing. At the core of any elastic system is an automated controller. This paper addresses elastic control for multi-tier application services that allocate and release resources in discrete units, such as virtual server instances of predetermined sizes. It focuses on elastic control of the storage tier, in which adding or removing a storage node or "brick" requires rebalancing stored data across the nodes. The storage tier presents new challenges for elastic control: actuator delays (lag) due to rebalancing, interference with applications and sensor measurements, and the need to synchronize the multiple control elements, including rebalancing. We have designed and implemented a new controller for elastic storage systems to address these challenges. Using a popular distributed storage system - the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) - under dynamic Web 2.0 workloads, we show how the controller adapts to workload changes to maintain performance objectives efficiently in a pay-as-you-go cloud computing environment.},

 abstract = {We study the problem of designing sensor sets for capturing energy events in buildings. In addition to direct energy sens- ing methods, e.g. electricity and gas, it is often desirable to monitor energy use and occupant activity through other sensors such as temperature and motion. However, practical constraints such as cost and deployment requirements can limit the choice, quantity and quality of sensors that can be distributed within each building, especially for large-scale deployments. In this paper, we present an approach to select a set of sensors for capturing energy events, using a measure of each candidate sensorâs ability to predict energy events within a building. We use constrained optimisation â specif- ically, a bounded knapsack problem (BKP) â to choose the best sensors for the set given each sensorâs predictive value and specified cost constraints. Our approach arises from a field study of 4 UK homes with temperature, light, motion, humidity, sound and CO2 sensors. By using random forests to generate a measure of each sensorâs predictive value, and financial cost as a measure of each sensorâs cost, the results show that these environmental sensors are useful predictors of energy use, though the optimal sets vary substantially with the constraint parameters. Furthermore, valuable yet expen- sive sensors such as CO2 are often not chosen in the opti- mal set, and a proportion of both CO2 and light level can be predicted from the other environmental sensors used in the study.},

 abstract = {The treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) has undergone significant developments in recent years. The availability of the novel agents thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide has expanded treatment options and has improved the outcome of patients with MM. Following the introduction of these agents in the relapsed/refractory setting, they are also undergoing investigation in the initial treatment of MM. A number of phase III trials have demonstrated the efficacy of novel agent combinations in the transplant and nontransplant settings, and based on these results standard induction regimens are being challenged and replaced. In the transplant setting, a number of newer induction regimens are now available that have been shown to be superior to the vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone regimen. Similarly, in the front-line treatment of patients not eligible for transplantation, regimens incorporating novel agents have been found to be superior to the traditional melphalan plus prednisone regimen. Importantly, some of the novel agents appear to be active in patients with high-risk disease, such as adverse cytogenetic features, and certain comorbidities, such as renal impairment. This review presents an overview of the most recent data with these novel agents and summarizes European treatment practices incorporating the novel agents.},

Whole-home energy measurement is cheap and easy to set up because it requires only one sensor where the home connects to the power grid. The collected data can provide useful information for large appliances. However, the only way to monitor smaller devices' energy use is to install an energy meter on every device. This creates a detailed picture of household energy consumption but requires much additional hardwareâone meter per device in the home. An alternative, more practical, approach to monitor household energy use includes small devices by using circuit-level power measurements. Two proposed algorithms disaggregate the circuit-level data into device-level estimates. An evaluation of these algorithms produced an average error of less than 5.35 percent for each device. So, they enable the development of highly intelligent automated energy management systems.},

 abstract = {With the latest high-end computing nodes combining shared-memory multiprocessing with hardware multithreading, new scheduling policies are necessary for workloads consisting of multithreaded applications. The use of hybrid multiprocessors presents schedulers with the problem of job pairing, i.e. deciding which specific jobs can share each processor with minimum performance penalty, by running on different execution contexts. Therefore, scheduling policies are expected to decide not only which job mix will execute simultaneously across the processors, but also which jobs can be combined within each processor.This paper addresses the problem by introducing new scheduling policies that use run-time performance information to identify the best mix of threads to run across processors and within each processor. Scheduling of threads across processors is driven by the memory bandwidth utilization of the threads, whereas scheduling of threads within processors is driven by one of three metrics: bus transaction rate per thread, stall cycle rate per thread, or outermost level cache miss rate per thread. We have implemented and experimentally evaluated these policies on a real multiprocessor server with Intel Hyperthreaded processors.The policy using bus transaction rate for thread pairing achieves an average 13.4{\%} and a maximum 28.7{\%} performance improvement over the Linux scheduler. The policy using stall cycle rate for thread pairing achieves an average 9.5{\%} and a maximum 18.8{\%} performance improvement. The average and maximum performance gains of the policy using cache miss rate for thread pairing are 7.2{\%} and 23.6{\%} respectively.},

Interleaved, we track the camera's 6DOF motion precisely by frame-rate whole image alignment against the entire dense model.

At best, the lack of a standard metadata schema makes it unnecessarily time-consuming to write software to process multiple datasets and, at worse, the lack of a standard means that crucial information is simply absent from some datasets.

 abstract = {The goal of analyzing a time series database is to find whether and how frequent a periodic pattern is repeated within the series. Periodic pattern mining is the problem that regards temporal regularity. However, most of the existing algorithms have a major limitation in mining interesting patterns of users interest, that is, they can mine patterns of specific length with all the events sequentially one after another in exact positions within this pattern. Though there are certain scenarios where a pattern can be flexible, that is, it may be interesting and can be mined by neglecting any number of unimportant events in between important events with variable length of the pattern. Moreover, existing algorithms can detect only specific type of periodicity in various time series databases and require the interaction from user to determine periodicity. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm for the periodic pattern mining in time series databases which does not rely on the user for the period value or period type of the pattern and can detect all types of periodic patterns at the same time, indeed these flexibilities are missing in existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm facilitates the user to generate different kinds of patterns by skipping intermediate events in a time series database and find out the periodicity of the patterns within the database. It is an improvement over the generating pattern using suffix tree, because suffix tree based algorithms have weakness in this particular area of pattern generation. Comparing with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves generating different kinds of interesting patterns and detects whether the generated pattern is periodic or not. We have tested the performance of our algorithm on both synthetic and real life data from different domains and found a large number of interesting event sequences which were missing in existing algorithms and the proposed algorithm was efficient enough in generating and detecting periodicity of flexible patterns on both types of data.},

Work performed by the authors and other researchers has shown that individual loads can be detected and separated from rapid sampling of power at a single point serving a number of pieces of equipment, for example the electrical service entrance for an entire house or all of the central space-conditioning equipment in a commercial building. This technique has worked well in tests in houses but faces more difficult challenges in commercial buildings. We present our results for this centralized or non-intrusive load monitoring technique, applied to the space-conditioning equipment in an office/laboratory building in which equipment start-up and shut-down was centrally observed and analyzed on the basis of changes in steady-state power. We further describe our enhanced technique for distinguishing loads by matching start-up transients to known patterns, and present laboratory tests of fully automated detection hardware and software.},

 abstract = {Abstract This paper investigates the use of actual monitored household energy as an indicator of the thermal efficiency of a dwelling and subsequently rating of the building thermal performance. The paper reviews evaluation methods used internationally for both building thermal efficiency and building energy labelling and presents results from two discrete studies in South Australia on monitoring actual household energy consumption. In order to investigate the occupancy effect on household energy, monitored energy data collected from two different housing developments in South Australia were examined. The energy ratings for these homes are compliant with the national agreed protocols for thermal performance modelling of dwellings, where one set of homes is a group occupied by higher socio-economic groups and the other is low income public housing in a colder climate region with much poorer home energy ratings. The wide variation of actual household energy for the homes that have relatively similar thermal envelopes indicates a lack of meaningful use for actual household energy in disclosure of house energy performance. Therefore, it is argued that thermal modelling software used to rate homes appears a more useful application of a system of disclosure of energy performance than the use of energy bills.},

 abstract = {Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring is the process of disaggregating a household's total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances. In this paper we propose an approach by which individual appliances can be iteratively separated from an aggregate load. Unlike existing approaches, our approach does not require training data to be collected by sub-metering individual appliances, nor does it assume complete knowledge of the appliances present in the household. Instead, we propose an approach in which prior models of general appliance types are tuned to specific appliance instances using only signatures extracted from the aggregate load. The tuned appliance models are then used to estimate each appliance's load, which is subsequently subtracted from the aggregate load. This process is applied iteratively until all appliances for which prior behaviour models are known have been disaggregated. We evaluate the accuracy of our approach using the REDD data set, and show the disaggregation performance when using our training approach is comparable to when sub-metered training data is used. We also present a deployment of our system as a live application and demonstrate the potential for personalised energy saving feedback.},

 abstract = {Historically, the performance and purchase price of enterprise information systems have been the key
arguments in purchasing decisions. With rising energy costs and increasing power use due to the ever-
growing demand for compute capacity (servers, storage, networks etc.), electricity bills have become
a significant expense for todays data centers. In the very near future, energy efficiency is expected
to be one of the key purchasing arguments. Having realized this trend, the Transaction Processing
Performance Council has developed the TPC-Energy specification. It defines a standard methodology
for measuring, reporting and fairly comparing power consumption of enterprise information systems.
Wide industry adaption of TPC-Energy requires a large body of benchmark publications across multiple
software and hardware platforms, which could take several years. Meanwhile, we believe that analytical
power estimates based on nameplate power is a useful tool for estimating power consumption of TPC
benchmark configurations as well as enterprise information systems. This paper presents enhancements
to previously published energy estimation models based on the TPC-C and TPC-H benchmarks from the
same authors and a new model, based on the TPC-E benchmark. The models can be applied to estimate
power consumption of enterprise OLTP and Decision Support systems.},

 abstract = {<p><br/>Arctic sea-ice extent and volume are declining rapidly. Several studies project that the Arctic Ocean may become seasonally ice-free by the year 2040 or even earlier. Putting this into perspective requires information on the history of Arctic sea-ice conditions through the geologic past. This information can be provided by proxy records from the Arctic Ocean floor and from the surrounding coasts. Although existing records are far from complete, they indicate that sea ice became a feature of the Arctic by 47Â Ma, following a pronounced decline in atmospheric pCO2 after the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Optimum, and consistently covered at least part of the Arctic Ocean for no less than the last 13-14 million years. Ice was apparently most widespread during the last 2-3 million years, in accordance with Earth's overall cooler climate. Nevertheless, episodes of considerably reduced sea ice or even seasonally ice-free conditions occurred during warmer periods linked to orbital variations. The last low-ice event related to orbital forcing (high insolation) was in the early Holocene, after which the northern high latitudes cooled overall, with some superimposed shorter-term (multidecadal to millennial-scale) and lower-magnitude variability. The current reduction in Arctic ice cover started in the late 19th century, consistent with the rapidly warming climate, and became very pronounced over the last three decades. This ice loss appears to be unmatched over at least the last few thousand years and unexplainable by any of the known natural variabilities.</p>},

@phdthesis{proper2008,
 abstract = {The Non-Intrusive Load Monitor (NILM) is a device that utilizes voltage and current measurements to monitor an entire system from a single reference point. The NILM and associated software convert the V/I signal to spectral power envelopes that can be searched to determine when a transient occurs. The identification of this signal can then be determined by an expert classifier and a series of these classifications can be used to diagnose system failures or improper operation. Current NILM research conducted at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems (LEES) is exploring the application and expansion of NILM technology for the use of monitoring shipboard systems. This thesis presents the ginzu application that implements a detect-classify-verify loop that locates the indexes of transients, identifies them using a decision-tree based expert classifier, and then generates a summary event file containing relevant information. The ginzu application provides a command-line interface between streaming preprocessed power data (PREP) and an included graphical user interface. This software was developed using thousands of hours of archived data from the Coast Guard Cutters ESCANABA (WMEC-907) and SENECA (WMEC-906). A validation of software effectiveness was conducted as the software was installed onboard ESCANABA.},

Limitations of inexpensive commercial devices such as resolution and measurement accuracy are a challenge. An algorithm currently under development, specifically developed for the low resolution of inexpensive commercial sensor packages, will be discussed and demonstrated.

Changes in lighting and the effects of perspective also pose no problems. How do we achieve this, and more importantly, how can we get a computer to do this? One very promising approach is to find mathematical functions of an object's image, or of an object's 3D description, that are invariant to the transformations caused by the object's motion. This book is devoted to the theory and practice of such invariant image features, so-called image invariants, for planar objects. It gives a comprehensive summary of the field, discussing methods for recognizing both occluded and partially occluded objects, and also contains a definitive treatmentof moment invariants and a tutorial introduction to algebraic invariants, which are fundamental to affine moment invariants and to many projective invariants. A number of novel invariant functions are presented and the results of numerous experiments investigating the stability of new and old invariants are discussed. The main conclusion is that moment invariants are very effective, both for partially occluded objects and for recognizing objects in grey-level images.},

@article{rouvellou1995,
 abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of identifying a probabilistic FSM from its output. The authors propose a formal description of the FSM and its output, using a regular phrase-structured grammar. This description is associated with a cost measuring its information content. The authors then state the inference problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with an objective function define as the cost of the description of the FSM and its output. A heuristic algorithm is proposed which processes the output âon lineâ and yields a local minimum of the authors' criterion. At each step (i.e. as new data is observed and processed), the procedure searches locally through the space of non-probabilistic FSMs, i.e., the transitions are initially regarded as being only present or absent. When a non-probabilistic model has been generated, the transition probabilities are determined from their relative frequencies given the behavior indicated by the data. This yields maximum likelihood estimates of the probabilities. The costs of the obtained probabilistic FSMs are then computed, and the K minimum cost FSMs are kept as starting points for the next step search. At each step, the generation of the FSMs is done via a local search through the neighborhoods of the K best FSMs obtained at the previous step. This algorithm is compared with similar algorithms proposed previously, and tested on a range of examples. It is found to work for a wider range of FSMs than the previous methods, and it is much more practical for large problems than previously proposed exhaustive search techniques},

 abstract = {Sensing, monitoring and actuating systems are expected to play a key role in reducing buildings overall energy consumption. Leveraging sensor systems to support energy efficiency in buildings poses novel research challenges in monitoring space usage, controlling devices, interfacing with smart energy meters and communicating with the energy grid. In the attempt of reducing electricity consumption in buildings, identifying individual sources of energy consumption is key to generate energy awareness and improve efficiency of available energy resources usage. Previous work studied several non-intrusive load monitoring techniques to classify appliances; however, the literature lacks of an comprehensive system that can be easily installed in existing buildings to empower users profiling, benchmarking and recognizing loads in real-time. This has been a major reason holding back the practice adoption of load monitoring techniques. In this paper we present RECAP: RECognition of electrical Appliances and Profiling in real-time. RECAP uses a single wireless energy monitoring sensor easily clipped to the main electrical unit. The energy monitoring unit transmits energy data wirelessly to a local machine for data processing and storage. The RECAP system consists of three parts: (1) Guiding the user for profiling electrical appliances within premises and generating a database of unique appliance signatures; (2) Using those signatures to train an artificial neural network that is then employed to recognize appliance activities (3) Providing a Load descriptor to allow peer appliance benchmarking. RECAP addresses the need of an integrated and intuitive tool to empower building owners with energy awareness. Enabling real-time appliance recognition is a stepping-stone towards reducing energy consumption and allowing a number of major applications including load-shifting techniques, energy expenditure breakdown per appliance, detection of power hungry and faulty appliances, and recogn- - ition of occupant activity. This paper describes the system design and performance evaluation in domestic environment.},

We compared PreHeat's prediction algorithm with a static program over an average 61 days per house, alternating days between these conditions, and measuring actual gas consumption and occupancy. In UK homes PreHeat both saved gas and reduced MissTime (the time that the house was occupied but not warm). In US homes, PreHeat decreased MissTime by a factor of 6-12, while consuming a similar amount of gas. In summary, PreHeat enables more efficient heating while removing the need for users to program thermostat schedules.},

While there is some research into power-aware storage stack components, there are no systematic studies evaluating each component's impact separately. Various factors like workloads, hardware configurations, and software configurations impact the performance and energy efficiency of the system. This article evaluates the file system's impact on energy consumption and performance. We studied several popular Linux file systems, with various mount and format options, using the FileBench workload generator to emulate four server workloads: Web, database, mail, and fileserver, on two different hardware configurations. The file system design, implementation, and available features have a significant effect on CPU/disk utilization, and hence on performance and power. We discovered that default file system options are often suboptimal, and even poor. In this article we show that a careful matching of expected workloads and hardware configuration to a single software configurationâthe file systemâcan improve power-performance efficiency by a factor ranging from 1.05 to 9.4 times.},

 abstract = {Computer vision is a rapidly growing field which aims to make computers see as effectively as humans. In this book Dr Shapiro presents a new computer vision framework for interpreting time-varying imagery. This is an important task, since movement reveals valuable information about the environment. The fully-automated system operates on long, monocular image sequences containing multiple, independently-moving objects, and demonstrates the practical feasibility of recovering scene structure and motion in a bottom-up fashion. Real and synthetic examples are given throughout, with particular emphasis on image coding applications. Novel theory is derived in the context of the affine camera, a generalisation of the familiar scaled orthographic model. Analysis proceeds by tracking 'corner features' through successive frames and grouping the resulting trajectories into rigid objects using new clustering and outlier rejection techniques. The three-dimensional motion parameters are then computed via affine epipolar geometry, and affine structure is used to generate alternative views of the object and fill in partial views. The use of all available features (over multiple frames) and the incorporation of statistical noise properties substantially improves existing algorithms, giving greater reliability and reduced noise sensitivity.},

There are numerous methods that limit the impact of both factors, such as expanding the use of renewable energy or participating in automated demand-response programs. To take advantage of these methods, servers and applications must gracefully handle intermittent constraints in their power supply. In this paper, we propose blinking---metered transitions between a high-power active state and a low-power inactive state---as the primary abstraction for conforming to intermittent power constraints. We design Blink, an application-independent hardware-software platform for developing and evaluating blinking applications, and define multiple types of blinking policies. We then use Blink to design BlinkCache, a blinking version of memcached, to demonstrate the effect of blinking on an example application. Our results show that a load-proportional blinking policy combines the advantages of both activation and synchronous blinking for realistic Zipf-like popularity distributions and wind/solar power signals by achieving near optimal hit rates (within 15{\%} of an activation policy), while also providing fairer access to the cache (within 2{\%} of a syn- chronous policy) for equally popular objects.},

Measurements of the stator currents and voltages are required for the identification procedure, but no measurements from the motor shaft are needed. The first method presented applies simple models with limited temporal domains of validity and obtains parameter estimates by extrapolating the model error bias to zero. This method does not minimize any specific error criterion and is presented as a means of finding a good initial guess for a conventional iterative maximum-likelihood or least-squares estimator. The second method presented minimizes equation errors in the induction motor model in the least-square sense using a Levenburg-Marquardt iteration. The third identification method is a continuation of the Levenburg-Marquardt method, motivated by observed properties of some pathological loss functions. The third method minimizes errors in the observations in the least-squared sense and is, therefore, a maximum-likelihood estimator under appropriate conditions of normality. The performance of the identification schemes is demonstrated with both simulated and measured data, and parameters obtained using the methods are compared with parameters obtained from standard tests},

This task is particularly important for matching images across visual domains, such as photos taken over different seasons or lighting conditions, paintings, hand-drawn sketches, etc. We propose a surprisingly simple method that estimates the relative importance of different features in a query image based on the notion of "data-driven uniqueness". We employ standard tools from discriminative object detection in a novel way, yielding a generic approach that does not depend on a particular image representation or a specific visual domain. Our approach shows good performance on a number of difficult cross-domain visual tasks e.g., matching paintings or sketches to real photographs. The method also allows us to demonstrate novel applications such as Internet re-photography, and painting2gps. While at present the technique is too computationally intensive to be practical for interactive image retrieval, we hope that some of the ideas will eventually become applicable to that domain as well.},

Field tests were performed at a 160Â MW coal-fired unit to investigate the relationships between process controllable variables, and optimization targets and constraints. Based on the test data, a modified on-line support vector regression model was proposed for characteristic function approximation, in which the model parameters can be continuously adapted for changes in coal quality and other conditions of plant equipment. The optimization scheme was implemented by a genetic algorithm in two stages. Firstly, the multi-objective combustion optimization problem was solved to achieve an optimal Pareto front, which contains optimal solutions for lowest unit heat rate and lowest NOx emissions. Secondly, best operating settings for the boiler, and SCR system and air preheater were obtained for lowest operating cost under the constraints of NOx emissions limit and air preheater ammonium bisulfate deposition depth.</p>},

@article{solomon2009,
 abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450â600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the âdust bowlâ era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4â1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6â1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding â1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

 abstract = {In network intrusion detection research, one popular strategy for finding attacks is monitoring a network's activity for anomalies: deviations from profiles of normality previously learned from benign traffic, typically identified using tools borrowed from the machine learning community. However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational "real world" settings. We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively. We support this claim by identifying challenges particular to network intrusion detection, and provide a set of guidelines meant to strengthen future research on anomaly detection.},

In this approach, NNs are trained to extract important features from the input current waveform to uniquely identify various types of devices using their distinct harmonic "signatures". Such automated, noninvasive device identification will be critical in future power-quality monitoring and enhancement systems. Several NN-based classification models including multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) network, and support vector machines (SVM) with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels were developed for signature extraction and device identification. These models were trained and tested using spike train data gathered from the Fourier analysis of the input current waveform in the presence of multiple devices. The performance of these models was compared in terms of their accuracy, generalization ability, and noise tolerance limits. The results showed that MLPs and SVM were both able to determine the presence of devices based on their harmonic signatures with high accuracy. MLP was found to be the best signature identification method because of its low computational requirements and ability to extract the information necessary for highly accurate device identification.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a new nonintrusive appliance load monitoring technique based on the integer programming. Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring is a problem to identify the operating conditions of the electric appliances in a house only by observing the overall load current and voltage. Since the overall load current is expressed as a superposition of each current of the operating appliance, the monitoring problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic programming problem by expressing the operating conditions as integer variables. This problem is solvable with sufficiently small computational burden thanks to the recent development of the commercial software. The proposed method does not require the relearning even when a new appliance is installed in the house. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is applicable to cases that some appliance has multiple modes, and cases that some same-type appliances operate simultaneously. Usefulness of the proposed technique is verified through some experimental results.},

This approach allows for the loads to be categorised based on the electrical characteristics, and also provides information on the reactive power characteristics of the load, which is often neglected from standard consumption statistics. This data is particularly important for power system analysis. In addition to this, device ownership statistics and probability distribution functions of power demand are presented for the main residential loads.

@phdthesis{wichakool2011,
 abstract = {There is a need for flexible, inexpensive metering technologies that can be deployed in many different monitoring scenarios. Individual loads may be expected to compute information about their power consumption. Utility providers, facilities managers, and other consumers will likely find innumerable ways to mine information if made available in a useful form. However, appropriate sensing and information delivery systems remain a chief bottleneck for many applications, and metering hardware and access to metered information will likely limit the implementation of new electric energy conservation strategies in the near future. This thesis presents solutions for two long standing problems in nonintrusive power and diagnostic monitoring. First, a high-resolution, physically windowed sensor architecture that is well-suited for energy score-keeping and diagnostic applications will be discussed. The sensor can track a large-scale main signal while capturing small-scale variations. The prototype system uses digital techniques to reconstruct an observed current with a high effective bit resolution. The sensor measures a small current signal using a closed-loop Hall sensor. and extends the range by driving a compensation current with a high performance current source through an auxiliary winding. The system combines the compensation command and the sampled output of the residual sensor to reconstruct the input signal with high bit resolution and bandwidth. Second, a long-standing problem in nonintrusive power monitoring involves the tracking of power consumption in the in the presence of loads with a continuously variable power demand. Two new techniques have been developed for automatically disaggregating, in real-time. different classes of continuously variable power electronic loads which draw distorted line currents. Experimental results of the proposed power estimator extracting the power consumption of common variable power loads such as a variable speed drive, a computer, and a light dimmer are presented.},

 abstract = {Change-point models are generative models of time-varying data in which the underlying generative parameters undergo discontinuous changes at different points in time known as change points. Change-points often represent important events in the underlying processes, like a change in brain state reflected in EEG data or a change in the value of a company reflected in its stock price. However, change-points can be difficult to identify in noisy data streams. Previous attempts to identify change-points online using Bayesian inference relied on specifying in advance the rate at which they occur, called the hazard rate (h). This approach leads to predictions that can depend strongly on the choice of h and is unable to deal optimally with systems in which h is not constant in time. In this letter, we overcome these limitations by developing a hierarchical extension to earlier models. This approach allows h itself to be inferred from the data, which in turn helps to identify when change-points occur. We show that our approach can effectively identify change-points in both toy and real data sets with complex hazard rates and how it can be used as an ideal-observer model for human and animal behavior when faced with rapidly changing inputs.},

Methods that reward energy conservation in a number of ways have yielded meaningful short-run reductions. Extensions of current strategies and other procedures derived from a framework presented in the paper may eventually result in more pervasive, longer-term savings.

 abstract = {We propose a new framework for single-channel source separation that lies between the fully supervised and unsupervised setting. Instead of supervision, we provide input features for each source signal and use convex methods to estimate the correlations between these features and the unobserved signal decomposition. We analyze the case of {\$}\backslashell{\_}2{\$} loss theoretically and show that recovery of the signal components depends only on cross-correlation between features for different signals, not on correlations between features for the same signal. Contextually supervised source separation is a natural fit for domains with large amounts of data but no explicit supervision; our motivating application is energy disaggregation of hourly smart meter data (the separation of whole-home power signals into different energy uses). Here we apply contextual supervision to disaggregate the energy usage of thousands homes over four years, a significantly larger scale than previously published efforts, and demonstrate on synthetic data that our method outperforms the unsupervised approach.},

 abstract = {Due to the global warming and climate changes, using and conserving of the electrical energy effectively becomes a very important issue recently. If each appliance operates efficiently, the power energy can be used and conserved effectively. Further, the greenhouse gases can also gradually be reduced. This paper* proposes a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) system that employs a decision mechanism based on hierarchical support vector machines (HSVM) to identify the energizing and de-energizing statuses of each load. In the proposed system, the load energizing and de-energizing transient features are extracted from load current waveforms that are acquired at the power entering point. The HSVM performs load identification tasks based on the features. Although a support vector machine (SVM) identifier can solve nonlinear separable cases and optimize the decision hyper-plane, it is a two-class identifier. On the other hand, the NILM problem is a multi-class identification problem. Since any multi-class identification problem can be decomposed into a series of two-class identification sub-problems, the proposed system applies a group of binary SVMs that are arranged into a form of hierarchical tree to identify the operation status of each load. Each node within the tree represents a binary SVM identifier, and each identifier is assigned to solve a corresponding two-class sub-problem. Through this hierarchical decision process, the class of an undetermined datum can be identified. Finally, the results in different experiment environments show that the proposed system is able to identify the operation status of each load, and it also has appropriate robustness.},

We propose a new approach to disaggregation electricity consumption by individual appliances and/or end uses that would enhance the effectiveness of home energy displays. The proposed method decomposes a system of appliance models into tuplets of appliances overlapping in power draw. Each tuplet is disaggregated using a modified Viterbi algorithm. In this way, the complexity of the disaggregation algorithm is linearly proportional to the number of appliances. The superior accuracy of the method is illustrated by a simulation example and by actual household data.},

@article{zeng2002,
 abstract = {Energy consumption has recently been widely recognized as a major challenge of computer systems design. This paper explores how to support energy as a first-class operating system resource. Energy, because of its global system nature, presents challenges beyond those of conventional resource management. To meet these challenges we propose the Currentcy Model that unifies energy accounting over diverse hardware components and enables fair allocation of available energy among applications. Our particular goal is to extend battery lifetime by limiting the average discharge rate and to share this limited resource among competing task according to user preferences. To demonstrate how our framework supports explicit control over the battery resource we implemented ECOSystem, a modified Linux, that incorporates our currentcy model. Experimental results show that ECOSystem accurately accounts for the energy consumed by asynchronous device operation, can achieve a target battery lifetime, and proportionally shares the limited energy resource among competing tasks.},

Fine-grained energy monitoring can be achieved by deploying smart power outlets on every device of interest; however it incurs extra hardware cost and installation complexity. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an attractive method for energy disaggregation, as it can discern devices from the aggregated data acquired from a single point of measurement.
