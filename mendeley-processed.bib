  abstract                 = {Research on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), a technique for discerning individual appliance operation from whole-house measurements, has been underway for over 20 years [4],[5]. Most implementations utilize changes in the total real (P) and reactive (Q) power of a building as signatures for each appliance state transition. There are a small number of commercially available systems that implement NILM, albeit marketed for utilities as a tool for performing load research. As a proof of concept, and in order to obtain preliminary data that would help us evaluate the feasibility of using NILM to support electricity audits in a residential building, we decided to focus our attention on one of the top residential loads: the refrigerator. We installed a NILM prototype system in an apartment building, and a plug-level power meter was used to accurately track the individual consumption of this appliance. The experiment consisted in monitoring this load for a week, using the two methodologies (NILM and pluglevel meters), and then comparing the estimated energy consumption as computed by each.},

  abstract                 = {The need to achieve a transition to a low carbon economy has renewed interest in "energy efficiency" and what has become known as "demand side management". This thesis investigates the role of measurement and modelling in the management of domestic electricity demand. Practice and policy have, since the 1950s, tended to favour a "supply paradigm" centred on the imperative of increasing energy supply. Despite the upheaval of market liberalisation, and twenty years of climate change debate, the domestic electricity "culture" has changed very little. The first half of this thesis contributes to this subject by describing the complex development of the electricity system that we are familiar with today. Drawing upon technical, social and political themes, the current and emerging practices of measurement, modelling, and management are critiqued. It is argued that current practices require revaluation, if alternative, decentralised approaches are to receive a fair analysis. The thesis contributes in empirical terms by extending the evidence base and developing modelling tools for the analysis of domestic electricity use. Field data collected by the author concerning the power flow characteristics of domestic appliances are presented which identify the dynamic nature of domestic electrical loads. A modelling framework is then introduced that combines social and technical aspects of domestic energy demand, allowing synthesis of domestic load profiles and allowing comparison between localised interventions.},

  abstract                 = {The residential sector uses nearly 30{\%} of all electricity in Canada, and, it is important to know how this energy is being used, so that savings may be identified and realised. We propose a method that can be applied to hourly whole-house electrical energy data to partially disaggregate total household electricity use into five load categories/parameters (base load, activity load, heating season gradient, cooling season gradient and lowest external temperature at which air-conditioning is used). This paper develops the proposed method, and verifies it using high-resolution end-use data from twelve households with known characteristics. We then apply the method to hourly whole-house (smart meter) data from 327 households in Ontario. The roll-out of smart (advanced) metering infrastructure in many countries will make hourly whole-house data abundant, and we propose that this method could be widely applied by utilities to target their demand-side management programs towards households more likely to provide benefits, thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of such programs.},

The use of graphical models in applied statistics has increased considerably over recent years and the theory has been greatly developed and extended. This book provides a self-contained introduction to the learning of graphical models from data, and is the first to include detailed coverage of possibilistic networks - a relatively new reasoning tool that allows the user to infer results from problems with imprecise data. One major advantage of graphical modelling is that specialised techniques that have been developed in one field can be transferred into others easily. The methods described here are applied in a number of industries, including a recent quality testing programme at a major car manufacturer. * Provides a self-contained introduction to learning relational, probabilistic and possibilistic networks from data * Each concept is carefully explained and illustrated by examples * Contains all necessary background, including modeling under uncertainty, decomposition of distributions, and graphical representation of decompositions * Features applications of learning graphical models from data, and problems for further research * Includes a comprehensive bibliography An essential reference for graduate students of graphical modelling, applied statistics, computer science and engineering, as well as researchers and practitioners who use graphical models in their work.},

applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness

powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development.
Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements

The Viterbi algorithm is modified to correct insertions and deletions as well as errors, still using a trellis diagram that has the same number of states as the FSM that generates the uncorrupted data. Two problems are examined. In the first problem the data is given in the traditional form of a string so the novel aspect is that insertions and deletions are now corrected. In the second problem, a unique string need not be given, but a regular language is given, and any string belonging to the regular language is a possible data string. Again, deletion addition, and changes of symbols are corrected. A direct generalization of the Viterbi decoding algorithm is thus proved to be an efficient technique for solving a much wider class of problems},

  abstract                 = {Power dissipation and thermal issues are increasingly significant in modern processors. As a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. Most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. In addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities. This paper presents Wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. Wattch is 1000X or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10{\%} of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. This paper presents several validations of Wattch's accuracy. In addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use Wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. We see Wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools. It also opens up the field of power-efficient computing to a wider range of researchers by providing a power evaluation methodology within the portable and familiar SimpleScalar framework.},

Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms.},

One can view these technologies as forming levels within a new, global computing platform. We aim to open a new area of research, called multiplicity computing, that takes a radically different approach to the engineering of applications for this platform. Unlike other efforts, which are largely focused on innovations within specific levels, multiplicity computing embraces the platform as a virtually unlimited space of essentially redundant resources. This space is formed as a whole from the cross product of resources available at each level in the platform, offering a "multiplicity" of end-to-end resources. We seek to discover fundamentally new ways of exploiting the combinatorial multiplicity of computational, communication, and storage resources to obtain scalable applications exhibiting improved quality, dependability, and security that are both predictable and measurable.},

We characterize the performance of the Hadoop implementation of MapReduce under different workloads. We also introduce quantitative models to guide operators and developers in improving the performance of MapReduce/Hadoop. A major, but somewhat unsurprising finding is that for workloads where the work rate is proportional to the amount of resources used, improving the performance as measured by traditional metrics such as job duration is equivalent to improving the performance as measured by lower energy consumed.},

prominent, with growing concern for power consumption and heat

especially interesting, with a large number of computers
concentrated in a small physical space. Prior work has looked at
energy efficient disks, servers, switches, and protocols. In
considering a fresh redesign of the Internet datacenter with
respect to energy efficiency, we believe that datacenter
applications are worthy of study. In this work, we examine the
energy efficiency of MapReduce, an increasingly popular
application for Internet datacenters. We measure the energy
consumption of MapReduce under workloads that stress different
parts of the system, and seek to understand the performance and
scalability behavior of MapReduce with respect to energy. From
these measurements, we propose energy saving mechanisms and
directions for future work in the area. Our key finding is that well-
configured system parameters and well-designed workloads can
improve the energy efficiency of MapReduce by more than 100{\%}
without significant modifications to the underlying MapReduce
infrastructure. Our work represents a first step in evaluating the
performance of Internet datacenter applications with respect to
energy.},

  abstract                 = {Energy disaggregation, also known as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), is the task of separating aggregate energy data for a whole building into the energy data for individual appliances. Studies have shown that simply providing disaggregated data to the consumer improves energy consumption behavior. However, placing individual sensors on every device in a home is not presently a practical solution. Disaggregation provides a feasible method for providing energy usage behavior data to the consumer which utilizes currently existing infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel framework to perform the energy disaggregation task. We model each individual device as a single-input, single-output system, where the output is the power consumed by the device and the input is the device usage. In this framework, the task of disaggregation translates into finding inputs for each device that generates our observed power consumption. We describe an implementation of this framework, and show its results on simulated data as well as data from a small-scale experiment.},

The winning model on the localization sub-task was a network that predicts a single bounding box and a confidence score for each object category in the image. Such a model captures the whole-image context around the objects but cannot handle multiple instances of the same object in the image without naively replicating the number of outputs for each instance. In this work, we propose a saliency-inspired neural network model for detection, which predicts a set of class-agnostic bounding boxes along with a single score for each box, corresponding to its likelihood of containing any object of interest. The model naturally handles a variable number of instances for each class and allows for cross-class generalization at the highest levels of the network. We are able to obtain competitive recognition performance on VOC2007 and ILSVRC2012, while using only the top few predicted locations in each image and a small number of neural network evaluations.},

DiskReduce is a modification of the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) enabling asynchronous compression of initially triplicated data down to RAID-class redundancy overheads.

The results prove that the whole-house electricity consumption can be disaggregated into its major end-uses, using a pattern recognition approach and only one sensor installed on the main electric entrance of the house. It also required a one-time submetering of the target appliances during the training period, of about a week, to find the electric characteristics of appliances. The results are provided in terms of daily load profiles, energy consumption and energy contribution of selected appliances. The proposed method was tested with monitored data from 3 weeks: (i) the training period of 1 week in October, (ii) the near-to-date testing period of 1 week in November and (iii) the far-to-date testing period of 1 week in January. For instance, the difference between monitored and estimated contribution is, for the month of October 1996, as follows: (i) 13 kW h or {\$}0.85 for the DHW heater and (ii) 6 kW h or {\$}0.36 for the refrigerator. The overall difference for both appliances does not exceed {\$}1.25 for the month of October, for a total electricity bill of 912 kW h and {\$}60.60, which appears to be acceptable for every homeowner. The errors in evaluating the daily energy consumption is between â10.5{\%} and 15.9{\%} for both the DWH heater and the refrigerator.},

  abstract                 = {Electrical load disaggregation for end-use recognition in the smart home has become an area of study of its own right. The most well-known examples are energy monitoring, health care applications, in-home activity modeling, and home automation. Real-time energy-use analysis for whole-home approaches needs to understand where and when the electrical loads are spent. Studies have shown that individual loads can be detected (and disaggregated) from sampling the power at one single point (e.g. the electric service entrance for the house) using a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) approach. In this paper, we focus on the feature extraction and pattern recognition tasks for non-intrusive residential electrical consumption traces. In particular, we develop an algorithm capable of determining the step-changes in signals that occur whenever a device is turned on or off, and which allows for the definition of a unique signature (ID) for each device. This algorithm makes use of features extracted from active and reactive powers and power factor. The classification task is carried out by Support Vector Machines and 5-Nearest Neighbors methods. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed signature for distinguishing the different loads.},

We consider a solution for disaggregating the electrical power consumption of individual appliances connected in a residential electricity network, with a single point of measurement. We pose the power disaggregation problem in the framework of multi-user detection. Two linear detection algorithms are then provided to determine which appliances are active in the network and in turn to determine their individual power consumptions. An experimental setup is described that was used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms along with simulation results.},

The web service is driven by a third party real-time energy tariff API (uSwitch), an energy data store, a set of algorithms for usage prediction, and appliance-level load disaggregation. We present the system design and user evaluation consisting of interviews and interface walkthroughs. We recruited participants from a previous study during which three months of their household's energy use was recorded to evaluate personalized recommendations in AgentSwitch. Our contributions are a) a systems architecture for personalized energy services; and b) findings from the evaluation that reveal challenges in designing energy-related recommender systems. In response to the challenges we formulate design recommendations to mitigate barriers to switching tariffs, to incentivize load shifting, and to automate energy management.}

The aim of this study was to replace the human observer, needed to score and analyze the behavior of animals, by a fully automated method. For this purpose, in a first step from a video recording of each rat, an activity profile was calculated, from which subsequently a set of meaningful properties was extracted. This set was finally used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Furthermore, specialized kernel functions, namely the so-called time resolved p-spectrum and modified optimal assignment kernels, were developed to calculate the similarity of activity profiles. Our method allows for a very reliable discrimination of animals treated with antidepressants of different classes (tricyclics imipramine and desipramine as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SSRI, fluoxetine) versus a vehicle-treated group. Moreover, our technique is able to classify between tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs.

  abstract                 = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a simple and effective framework for modelling time-varying spectral vector sequences. As a consequence, almost all present day large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems are based on HMMs. Whereas the basic principles underlying HMM-based LVCSR are rather straightforward, the approximations and simplifying assumptions involved in a direct implementation of these principles would result in a system which has poor accuracy and unacceptable sensitivity to changes in operating environment. Thus, the practical application of HMMs in modern systems involves considerable sophistication. The aim of this review is first to present the core architecture of a HMM-based LVCSR system and then describe the various refinements which are needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These refinements include feature projection, improved covariance modelling, discriminative parameter estimation, adaptation and normalisation, noise compensation and multi-pass system combination. The review concludes with a case study of LVCSR for Broadcast News and Conversation transcription in order to illustrate the techniques described.},

A significant fraction of the total cost of ownership of these large-scale storage systems is the cost of keeping hundreds of thousands of disks spinning. We present a simple idea that allows the storage system to turn off a large fraction of its disks, without incurring unacceptable performance penalties. Of particular appeal is the fact that our solution is not application-specific, and offers power-savings for a very generic data center model. In this paper, we describe our solution, identify the parameters that determine its cost-benefit tradeoffs, and present a simulator that allows us to explore this parameter space. We also present some initial simulation results that add weight to our claim that our solution represents a new power-saving opportunity for large-scale storage systems.},

  abstract                 = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be one of the most widely used tools for learning probabilistic models of time series data. In an HMM, information about the past is conveyed through a single discrete variableâthe hidden state. We discuss a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations, and relate it to the forwardâbackward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods. Within the variational framework, we present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for learning the parameters of the model. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that factorial HMMs can capture statistical structure in this data set which an unconstrained HMM cannot.},

  abstract                 = {Ocean acidification may have severe consequences for marine ecosystems; however, assessing its future impact is difficult because laboratory experiments and field observations are limited by their reduced ecologic complexity and sample period, respectively. In contrast, the geological record contains long-term evidence for a variety of global environmental perturbations, including ocean acidification plus their associated biotic responses. We review events exhibiting evidence for elevated atmospheric CO2, global warming, and ocean acidification over the past {\~{}}300 million years of Earthâs history, some with contemporaneous extinction or evolutionary turnover among marine calcifiers. Although similarities exist, no past event perfectly parallels future projections in terms of disrupting the balance of ocean carbonate chemistryâa consequence of the unprecedented rapidity of CO2 release currently taking place.},

This capability is provided within a general framework that builds a simulator starting from a microarchitectural specification of the interconnection network. A key component of this construction is the architectural-level parameterized power models that we have derived as part of this effort. Using component power models and a synthesized efficient power (and performance) simulator a microarchitect can rapidly explore the design space. As case studies, we demonstrate the use of Orion in determining optimal system parameters, in examining the effect of diverse traffic conditions, as well as evaluating new network microarchitectures. In each of the above, the ability to simultaneously monitor power and performance is key in determining suitable microarchitectures.},

Warming is larger in the Western Equatorial Pacific than in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific over the past century, and we suggest that the increased WestâEast temperature gradient may have increased the likelihood of strong El Ni{\~{n}}os, such as those of 1983 and 1998. Comparison of measured sea surface temperatures in the Western Pacific with paleoclimate data suggests that this critical ocean region, and probably the planet as a whole, is approximately as warm now as at the Holocene maximum and within â1Â°C of the maximum temperature of the past million years. We conclude that global warming of more than â1Â°C, relative to 2000, will constitute âdangerousâ climate change as judged from likely effects on sea level and extermination of species.},

The algorithm is similar to the Viterbi algorithm in that it is suitable for situations in which the uncorrupted data string is generated by a known finite-state process, but it is more versatile in that it can correct a much broader class of errors. Of particular importance is the fact that the algorithm corrects common context-sensitive errors, such as symbol changes, transpositions, mergers, splits, insertions, and deletions, which may be assigned different probabilities depending on the context of preceeding and subsequent symbols. As many communication channels can be modeled in this way, this algorithm is a significant extension over the Viterbi algorithm and previous decoding techniques. The notion of channel rules is introduced to provide a framework for the user to specify the channel operation. The algorithm is given in both an off-line form and a recursive form suitable for sequentially presented data streams. In most applications, the recursive form has computational complexity only a constant times that of the Viterbi algorithm},

  abstract                 = {For many years, the hidden Markov model (HMM) has been one of the most popular tools for analysing sequential data. One frequently used special case is the left-right model, in which the order of the hidden states is known. If knowledge of the duration of a state is available it is not possible to represent it explicitly with an HMM. Methods for modelling duration with HMM's do exist (Rabiner in Proc. IEEE 77(2):257---286, [1989]), but they come at the price of increased computational complexity. Here we present an efficient and robust algorithm for modelling duration in HMM's, and this algorithm is successfully used to control autonomous computer actors in a theatrical play.},

An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition.},

Given the hourly total consumption, we obtain the hourly weather-related and illumination-related electricity consumption, and subtract this out to get residual consumption. The second stage of the model is a flexible, agent-based analytical tool that allows disaggregation of residual consumption into a sum of consumptions by different groups of appliances. This tool can be used for a variety of applications including an optimization of demand-side management and/or a development of a set of desirable patterns for schedules of electricity-related activities in households (within an acceptable range of course) in order to minimize negative effects of high peak demand.},

Large portions of the hardware and software resources in these facilities must work in concert to efficiently deliver good levels of Internet service performance, something that can only be achieved by a holistic approach to their design and deployment. In other words, we must treat the datacenter itself as one massive warehouse-scale computer (WSC). We describe the architecture of WSCs, the main factors influencing their design, operation, and cost structure, and the characteristics of their software base. We hope it will be useful to architects and programmers of today's WSCs, as well as those of future many-core platforms which may one day implement the equivalent of today's WSCs on a single board.

Load recognition for identifying loads being connected and disconnected is applied to a NILM by using a neural network, especially for industrial electrical loads, even though some loads are activated at the nearly same time. In order to accurately decompose the aggregate load into its components, a feature-based model for describing the signatures of individual appliances and load combinations is used. The model will suggest the certain signatures which can be detected for all loads in order to indicate the activities of the separate components. To verify the performance of the model for the features selection, the data sets of the electrical loads and the load recognition techniques apply an electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and a neural network, respectively. The effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition are analyzed and compared by using the back propagation classifier and the learning vector quantization classifier. To obtain a maximum recognition accuracy rate, the calculation of the turn-on transient energy signature employs a window of samples, At, to adaptively segment a transient representative of a class of loads. Experiments performed with a variety of model data sets which reveal the back propagation classifier is superior to the learning quantization classifier in the effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition.},

popular approach to study energy consumption patterns
without instrumenting every device in an installation. The
resulting computational problem is to disaggregate total en-
ergy usage into usage by specific circuits and devices, to gain
insight into consumption patterns. We exploit the temporal
ordering implicit in on/off events of devices to uncover mo-
tifs (episodes) corresponding to the operation of individual
devices. Extracted motifs are then subjected to a sequence
of constraint checks to ensure that the resulting episodes are
interpretable. Our preliminary results show that motif min-
ing is adept at distinguishing devices with multiple power
levels and at disentangling the combinatorial operation of
devices},

The majority of patients received total body irradiation (TBI) combined with either melphalan (56.9{\%}) or cyclophosphamide (28.5{\%}). Overall, transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 37.9{\%} at 1 year and was not significantly different for patients receiving melphalan/TBI compared with cyclophosphamide/TBI. The overall complete remission (CR) rate, including patients in CR at the time of transplant, was greater for patients receiving melphalan/TBI (64.7{\%}) compared with cyclophosphamide/TBI (47.2{\%})(P = 0.085). A significantly higher proportion of patients with continuing disease at the time of transplant achieved CR post-transplant following melphalan/TBI conditioning compared with cyclophosphamide/TBI (52.9{\%} and 33.4{\%} respectively, P = 0.009). Relapse/progression rates at 5 years were significantly lower for melphalan/TBI (36.7{\%}) compared with cyclophosphamide/TBI (80.8{\%}, P < 0.0001) and remained significant in multivariate analysis. This resulted in an overall survival at 5 years of 44.1{\%} and 28.1{\%} for melphalan/TBI and cyclophosphamide/TBI, respectively (P = 0.059).

Yet, the interface design aspect of these systems has largely been ignored. Therefore, the role that interface design plays at the component level in driving actual energy savings from users is unclear. In this paper, we evaluate the impact interface design has on eco-feedback performance by investigating five established design components. We conducted a six week empirical study with 43 participants using a prototype eco-feedback interface. Analysis of usage data affirmed a statistically significant inverse correlation between user engagement (measured as logins) and energy consumption. Utilizing this relationship as a basis for performance, we expanded our analysis to evaluate the five design components. The study revealed statistically significant evidence corroborating that historical comparison and incentives are design components that drive higher engagement and thus reductions in energy consumption. Results for the normative comparison and disaggregation components were inconclusive, while results for the rewards and penalization component suggest that a revision to the penalization aspect of the component may be necessary. This study raises pertinent questions regarding the efficacy of various eco-feedback components in eliciting energy savings.},

Hadoop-an open-source implementation of MapReduce is widely used for short jobs requiring low response time. The current Hadoop implementation assumes that computing nodes in a cluster are homogeneous in nature. Data locality has not been taken into account for launching speculative map tasks, because it is assumed that most maps are data-local. Unfortunately, both the homogeneity and data locality assumptions are not satisfied in virtualized data centers. We show that ignoring the data-locality issue in heterogeneous environments can noticeably reduce the MapReduce performance. In this paper, we address the problem of how to place data across nodes in a way that each node has a balanced data processing load. Given a dataintensive application running on a Hadoop MapReduce cluster, our data placement scheme adaptively balances the amount of data stored in each node to achieve improved data-processing performance. Experimental results on two real data-intensive applications show that our data placement strategy can always improve the MapReduce performance by rebalancing data across nodes before performing a data-intensive application in a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster.},

It is demonstrated that either a three-state ESHMM or a standard HMM with an increased number of states is capable of closely matching both Gamma distributions and duration distributions of phonemes from the TIMIT corpus, as measured by Bhattacharyya distance to the true distributions. Standard HMMs are easily implemented with off-the-shelf tools, whereas duration models require substantial algorithmic development and have higher computational costs when implemented, suggesting that a simple adjustment to HMM topologies is perhaps a more efficient solution to the problem of duration than more complex approaches.},

  abstract                 = {There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the ubiquitous Hidden Markov Model for learning from sequential and time-series data. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi-Markovianity, which has been developed mainly in the parametric frequentist setting, to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicit-duration Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden semi-Markov Model (HDP-HSMM) and develop sampling algorithms for efficient posterior inference. The methods we introduce also provide new methods for sampling inference in the finite Bayesian HSMM and the HDP-HMM. Our modular Gibbs sampling methods can be embedded in samplers for larger hierarchical Bayesian models, adding semi-Markov chain modeling as another tool in the Bayesian inference toolbox. We demonstrate the utility of the HDP-HSMM and our inference methods on both synthetic and real experiments.},

However, a key challenge facing end-users in this environment is the ability to provision MapReduce applications to minimize the incurred cost, while obtaining the best performance. This paper firstmotivates the importance of optimally provisioning a MapReduce job, and demonstrates that existing approaches can result in far from optimal provisioning.

Detailed lifespan analysis of the files in a large-scale production Hadoop cluster at Yahoo! points at the viability of Green HDFS. Simulation results with real-worldYahoo! HDFS traces show that Green HDFS can achieve 24{\%} energy cost reduction by doing power management in only one top-level tenant directory in the cluster and meets all the scale-down mandates in spite of the unique scale-down challenges present in a Hadoop cluster.

  abstract                 = {Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) presents unique challenges to the existing energy-conservation techniques and makes it hard to scale-down servers. We propose an energy-conserving, hybrid, logical multi-zoned variant of HDFS for managing data-processing intensive, commodity Hadoop cluster. Green HDFS's data-classification-driven data placement allows scale-down by guaranteeing substantially long periods (several days) of idleness in a subset of servers in the datacenter designated as the Cold Zone. These servers are then transitioned to high-energy-saving, inactive power modes. This is done without impacting the performance of the Hot zone as studies have shown that the servers in the data-intensive compute clusters are under-utilized and, hence, opportunities exist for better consolidation of the workload on the Hot Zone. Analysis of the traces of a Yahoo! Hadoop cluster showed significant heterogeneity in the data's access patterns which can be used to guide energy-aware data placement policies. The trace-driven simulation results with three-month-long real-life HDFS traces from a Hadoop cluster at Yahoo! show a 26{\%} energy consumption reduction by doing only Cold zone power management. Analytical cost model projects savings of {\$}14.6 million in 3-year total cost of ownership (TCO) and simulation results extrapolate savings of {\$}2.4 million annually when Green-HDFS technique is applied across all Hadoop clusters (amounting to 38000 servers) at Yahoo.},

We apply our method on a data set of 1628 households' electricity consumption. The results show that weather, location and floor area are among the most important determinants of residential electricity consumption. In addition to these variables, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption, as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19 and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level, home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption.},

  abstract                 = {Wise management of electricity consumption is becoming increasingly important. Domestic electricity prices in the UK increased by 35 {\%} over the past 8 years; an upward trend which is unlikely to reverse any time soon. As well as the economic costs, the environmental problems associated with the combustion of fossil fuels are becoming increasingly detrimental to the well-being of many species, including our own. One of the cheapest and easiest ways to improve energy efficiency is to monitor one's electricity consumption using a type of smart meter called a âhome energy monitorâ available for around Â£40. These display whole-house consumption in real-time, allowing the user to learn which devices and behaviours consume the most energy. Studies have demonstrated that the feedback provided by energy monitors can enable users to reduce consumption by 5-15 {\%}. If every domestic user in the UK reduced electricity consumption by 10 {\%} then the UK's annual CO2 output would be reduced by 6 million tonnes. However, the information displayed by home energy monitors is not as useful as it could be. Home energy monitors measure aggregate consumption for an entire building. Research has demonstrated that disaggregated information describing appliance-by-appliance energy consumption is more effective than aggregate information. Disaggregation was first successfully implemented in the 1980s using sophisticated smart meters which provide rich, multi-dimensional raw sensor data. However, these sophisticated meters are not readily available at present. The main contribution of this project is to design, implement and evaluate three different algorithms for disaggregating the sparse, one-dimensional data output by inexpensive, popular and readily available home energy monitors. Each design is trained to recognise a device on the basis of one or more raw recordings of single-device power consumption (which we call signatures). The system is then given an unseen aggregate signal from which it must infer the start times, run duration and energy consumption of each device activation present in the aggregate data. The first design is a simple prototype which uses a least mean squares approach to matching a signature to an aggregate signal. As expected, this design succeeds only in a very limited set of contexts but the development of this prototype provided valuable insights. The second design represents a novel approach to determining a set of device power states by identifying peaks in the histogram of the device's signature but this design proved to not be ideal. The final design presented in this dissertation represents a novel approach to disaggregation whereby each device is modelled as a power state graph. Each graph vertex (node) represents a power state and each edge represents the conditions necessary to transition from the source to the destination power state. During disaggregation, every possible âfitâ of the power state graph to the aggregate data is represented as a tree structure where each tree vertex represents a power state and each tree edge represents the likelihood for the corresponding power state transition. For each complete âfitâ of the power state graph to the aggregate data, the disaggregation algorithm reports the start time, the average likelihood, the estimated run time and the estimated total energy consumption. This design has several attractive features: 1) it handles both simple devices and complex devices whose signatures contain power state sequences which repeat an arbitrary number of times; 2) it is probabilistic; 3) a power state graph can be learnt from one or more signatures and 4) the design estimates the energy consumed by each device activation. This design was evaluated by training it to recognise four real devices: a toaster, a kettle, a washing machine and a tumble drier. The system was then given 13 days of real aggregate data. For all devices except the tumble drier it detected every device activation in the aggregate data although there were a few false positives. The system failed to model the tumble drier, possibly because the drier has very rapid state transitions.},

Multiple such datasets have been released over the last few years but provide metadata in a disparate array of formats including CSV files and plain-text README files. At best, the lack of a standard metadata schema makes it unnecessarily time-consuming to write software to process multiple datasets and, at worse, the lack of a standard means that crucial information is simply absent from some datasets. We propose a metadata schema for representing appliances, meters, buildings, datasets, prior knowledge about appliances and appliance models. The schema is relational and provides a simple but powerful inheritance mechanism.},

Energy disaggregation is a computational technique for estimating appliance-by-appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal. To conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the `ground truth' demand of individual appliances. We present `UK-DALE': an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity at a sample rate of 16 kHz for the whole-house and at 1/6 Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from four homes, one of which was recorded for 499 days, the longest duration we are aware of for similar datasets. We also describe the low-cost, open-source, wireless system we built for collecting our dataset.},

These errors do not result solely from lack of information since they are made even by consumers who understand technical energymeasurement. To explain the persistence of a seemingly disadvantageous system, we show that consumer methods are cognitively efficient. They are easy to learn and use and are compatible with general-purpose budgeting tasks.

  abstract                 = {We consider the problem of detecting multiple changepoints in large data sets. Our focus is on applications where the number of changepoints will increase as we collect more data: for example in genetics as we analyse larger regions of the genome, or in finance as we observe time-series over longer periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimising a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalised likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favourably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies we show that our new method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative exact methods. We also compare with the Binary Segmentation algorithm for identifying changepoints, showing that the exactness of our approach can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the data.},

  abstract                 = {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a technique that determines the electrical load composition of a household through a single point of measurement at the main power feed. In contrast with the majority of the existing approaches to solve this problem which require training, here we explore an unsupervised approach to determine the number of appliances in the household, their power consumption and state, at any given moment. We attempt to achieve this without using any a priori information on the number and type of appliances. Our approach is to first create clusters of steady-state changes and then employ a matching pursuit algorithm to reconstruct the original power signals using the clusters that were found as the sources in a linear blind source separation strategy. Changes in steady-state, sometimes referred to as events, are characterized by their change in real and reactive power (P and Q). Ultimately, the results may be applied to other features in an attempt to improve the separation between clusters. The preliminary results point toward a mixed scenario: large appliances (roughly above 400W) were easily identified, but the small appliances typically clustered together and were difficult to separate. We conclude that the errors occur during clustering which indicates that, in order to increase the purity of the clusters, perhaps other features could be used.},

Several effort to use low power machines in the data center level has been explored. Also, data processing frameworks such as MapReduce and Hadoop are frequently used to process data intensive jobs. However, there have not been an extensive study on the impact of low power computers on such data processing frameworks. Actually, development of low power computers is demanding the architectural paradigm shift for cloud applications. In this paper, we evaluate Apache Hadoop on low power machines and study the feasibility of them in cloud systems. We also propose AnSwer (Augmentation and Substitution), an energy saving method to reduce energy consumption by introducing low power machines. In An-Swer, augmentation and substitution complement each other to prevent data loss and to improve overall power consumption.},

  abstract                 = {Saving energy for storage is of major importance as storage devices (and cooling them off) may contribute over 25 percent of the total energy consumed in a datacenter. Recent work introduced the concept of energy proportionality and argued that it is a more relevant metric than just energy saving as it takes into account the tradeoff between energy consumption and performance. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called FREP (Fractional Replication for Energy Proportionality), for energy management in large datacenters. FREP includes a replication strategy and basic functions to enable flexible energy management. Specifically, our method provides performance guarantees by adaptively controlling the power states of a group of disks based on observed and predicted workloads. Our experiments, using a set of real and synthetic traces, show that FREP dramatically reduces energy requirements with a minimal response time penalty.},

  abstract                 = {This paper considers additive factorial hidden Markov models, an extension to HMMs where the state factors into multiple independent chains, and the output is an additive function of all the hidden states. Although such models are very powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly susceptible to local optima. In this paper we propose an alternative inference method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a "robust" mixture component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time. Combining these elements we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing approaches in practice. The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate signal.},

are well suited to be such supply-following loads. They are large energy consumers, highly instrumented,
agile, and contain much scheduling slack in their workloads. We explore the problem of scheduling the
workload to align with the time-varying available wind power. Using simulations driven by real life
batch workloads and wind power traces, we demonstrate that simple, supply-following job schedulers

Data-mining algorithms capture the relationships among the power output, power factor, and controllable and non-controllable variables of a 1.5Â MW wind turbine. An evolutionary strategy algorithm solves the data-derived optimization model and determines optimal control settings. Computational experience has demonstrated opportunities to improve the power factor and the power output by optimizing set points of blade pitch angle and generator torque. It is shown that the pitch angle and the generator torque can be controlled to maximize the energy capture from the wind and enhance the quality of the power produced by the wind turbine with a DFIG generator. These improvements are in the presence of reactive power remedies used in modern wind turbines. The concepts proposed in this paper are illustrated with the data collected at an industrial wind farm.</p>},

Load signatures of typical yet extensive loads are needed to be collected before applying them to different services and products. As there are an enormous number of electrical appliances, it is beneficial to classify the appliances for building a well-organized load signature database. The objective of this study is to develop an effective method to classify the loads. A 2-dimensional form of load signatures, voltage-current (V-l) trajectory, is suggested for characterizing the typical household appliances.Hierarchical clustering method was employed to classify the appliances and construct the taxonomy of the appliances. The taxonomy based on V-l trajectory was compared to the taxonomies based on traditional power metrics and eigenvectors in the previous studies. It was found that the groups of appliances in the taxonomy based on V-I trajectory were well-separated and had engineering meanings .},

the addition of an energy efficiency metric along with traditional performance metrics. This change
is fueled by the growing, real, and urgent demand for energy-efficient database processing. Database
query processing engines must now consider becoming energy-aware, else they risk missing many op-
portunities for significant energy savings. While other recent work has focused on solely optimizing for
energy efficiency, we recognize that such methods are only practical if they also consider performance
requirements specified in SLAs. The focus of this paper is on the design and evaluation of a general
framework for query optimization that considers both performance constraints and energy consumption
as first-class optimization criteria. Our method recognizes and exploits the evolution of modern comput-
ing hardware that allows hardware components to operate in different energy and performance states.
Our optimization framework considers these states and uses an energy consumption model for database
query operations. We have also built a model for an actual commercial DBMS. Using our model the
query optimizer can pick query plans that meet traditional performance goals (e.g., specified by SLAs),
but result in lower energy consumption. Our experimental evaluations show that our system-wide en-
ergy savings can be significant and point toward greater opportunities with upcoming energy-aware
technologies on the horizon.},

One class of techniques to reduce the energy consumption of clusters is to selectively power down nodes during periods of low utilization to increase energy efficiency. One can think of a number of ways of selectively powering down nodes, each with varying impact on the workload response time and overall energy consumption. Since the MapReduce framework is becoming "ubiquitous", the focus of this paper is on developing a framework for systematically considering various MapReduce node power down strategies, and their impact on the overall energy consumption and workload response time. We closely examine two extreme techniques that can be accommodated in this framework. The first is based on a recently proposed technique called "Covering Set" (CS) that keeps only a small fraction of the nodes powered up during periods of low utilization. At the other extreme is a technique that we propose in this paper, called the All-In Strategy (AIS). AIS uses all the nodes in the cluster to run a workload and then powers down the entire cluster. Using both actual evaluation and analytical modeling we bring out the differences between these two extreme techniques and show that AIS is often the right energy saving strategy.},

We leverage the insight that servers in a cluster are often underutilized, which makes it attractive to consider powering down some servers and redistributing their load to others. Of course, powering down servers naively will render data stored only on powered down servers inaccessible. While data replication can be exploited to power down servers without losing access to data, unfortunately, care must be taken in the design of the replication and server power down schemes to avoid creating load imbalances on the remaining "live" servers. Accordingly, in this paper we study the interaction between energy management, load balancing, and replication strategies for data-intensive cluster computing. In particular, we show that Chained Declustering -- a replication strategy proposed more than 20 years ago -- can support very flexible energy management schemes.},

However, the key tacit assumption that drives such a solution is that the proportional scale-out of such low-power cluster nodes results in constant scaleup in performance. This paper studies the validity of such an assumption using measured price and performance results from a low-power Atom-based node and a traditional Xeon-based server and a number of published parallel scaleup results. Our results show that in most cases, computationally complex queries exhibit disproportionate scaleup characteristics which potentially makes scale-out with low-end nodes an expensive and lower performance solution.},

  abstract                 = {Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) can determine operating schedule of electrical loads in a target system from measurements made at a centralized location, such as the electric utility service entry. NILM is an ideal platform for extracting useful information about any system that uses electromechanical devices. It has a low installation cost and high reliability because it uses a bare minimum of sensors. It is possible to use modem state and parameter estimation algorithms to verify remotely the "health" of electromechanical loads by using NILM to analyze measured waveforms associated with the operation of individual loads. NILM can also monitor the operation of the electrical distribution system itself, identifying situations where two or more otherwise healthy loads interfere with each other's operation through voltage waveform distortion or power quality problems. Strategies for nonintrusive monitoring have developed over the last 20 years. Advances in computing technology make a new wealth of computational tools useful in practical, field-based NILM systems. This article reviews techniques for high-performance nonintrusive load and diagnostic monitoring and illustrates key points with results from field tests.},

  abstract                 = {Obtaining high quality information economically and reliably is always a difficult objective to achieve. The electric power industry and consumers recently face many challenges, such as deregulation, autonomous power systems and power quality. The knowledge of the nature and state of the power systems will undoubtedly be the key in meeting these challenges. The Non-Intrusive Power Monitor is a novel attempt to collect such information with a minimal physical installation. Raw voltage and current are measured at a single location to yield harmonic power signals. They typically carry the fingerprints of the electric loads present in a system, and their analysis can produce such information as the operational and diagnostic status of the loads. The power signals can also be used for the system identification, parameter estimation and energy consumption optimization study. In this research, the power signals are mostly modeled as stochastic processes and various detection, estimation and pattern recognition algorithms are developed to extract desired information. A constant load status identifier is developed in this thesis which can identify the ON and OFF status of electric loads, both from their steady-state power consumptions and transient patterns. The identifier can also classify multiple load events occurring at a same time and estimate states without load events. The power consumed by a variable speed drive is also estimated using the correlations between the fundamental powers and higher harmonic powers. The harmonic signal generated by the imbalance of a rotating machine is estimated to monitor the drive, i.e. its speed and magnitude of the imbalance. The algorithms are thoroughly tested using the data collected at real buildings, and some of them are implemented on-line.},

measure and represent load characteristics, and (2) the development of signal processing techniques and estimation algorithms for
signal filtering, signal disaggregation and load recognition. This paper presents the methodology and observations of the load
signatures in their operation modes. The current and voltage of typical appliances are measured, and characteristics of the
waveform signatures so obtained are analyzed. By studying the collected data, it is planned to develop an algorithm that can

  abstract                 = {Distributed processing frameworks, such as Yahoo!'s Hadoop and Google's MapReduce, have been successful at harnessing expansive datacenter resources for large-scale data analysis. However, their effect on datacenter energy efficiency has not been scrutinized. Moreover, the filesystem component of these frameworks effectively precludes scale-down of clusters deploying these frameworks (i.e. operating at reduced capacity). This paper presents our early work on modifying Hadoop to allow scale-down of operational clusters. We find that running Hadoop clusters in fractional configurations can save between 9{\%} and 50{\%} of energy consumption, and that there is a tradeoff between performance energy consumption. We also outline further research into the energy-efficiency of these frameworks.},

  abstract                 = {Elasticity - where systems acquire and release resources in response to dynamic workloads, while paying only for what they need - is a driving property of cloud computing. At the core of any elastic system is an automated controller. This paper addresses elastic control for multi-tier application services that allocate and release resources in discrete units, such as virtual server instances of predetermined sizes. It focuses on elastic control of the storage tier, in which adding or removing a storage node or "brick" requires rebalancing stored data across the nodes. The storage tier presents new challenges for elastic control: actuator delays (lag) due to rebalancing, interference with applications and sensor measurements, and the need to synchronize the multiple control elements, including rebalancing. We have designed and implemented a new controller for elastic storage systems to address these challenges. Using a popular distributed storage system - the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) - under dynamic Web 2.0 workloads, we show how the controller adapts to workload changes to maintain performance objectives efficiently in a pay-as-you-go cloud computing environment.},

  abstract                 = {MapReduce offers an ease-of-use programming paradigm for processing large data sets, making it an attractive model for distributed volunteer computing systems. However, unlike on dedicated resources, where MapReduce has mostly been deployed, such volunteer computing systems have significantly higher rates of node unavailability. Furthermore, nodes are not fully controlled by the MapReduce framework. Consequently, we found the data and task replication scheme adopted by existing MapReduce implementations woefully inadequate for resources with high unavailability. To address this, we propose MOON, short for MapReduce On Opportunistic eNvironments. MOON extends Hadoop, an open-source implementation of MapReduce, with adaptive task and data scheduling algorithms in order to offer reliable MapReduce services on a hybrid resource architecture, where volunteer computing systems are supplemented by a small set of dedicated nodes. Our tests on an emulated volunteer computing system, which uses a 60-node cluster where each node possesses a similar hardware configuration to a typical computer in a student lab, demonstrate that MOON can deliver a three-fold performance improvement to Hadoop in volatile, volunteer computing environments.},

  abstract                 = {We study the problem of designing sensor sets for capturing energy events in buildings. In addition to direct energy sens- ing methods, e.g. electricity and gas, it is often desirable to monitor energy use and occupant activity through other sensors such as temperature and motion. However, practical constraints such as cost and deployment requirements can limit the choice, quantity and quality of sensors that can be distributed within each building, especially for large-scale deployments. In this paper, we present an approach to select a set of sensors for capturing energy events, using a measure of each candidate sensorâs ability to predict energy events within a building. We use constrained optimisation â specif- ically, a bounded knapsack problem (BKP) â to choose the best sensors for the set given each sensorâs predictive value and specified cost constraints. Our approach arises from a field study of 4 UK homes with temperature, light, motion, humidity, sound and CO2 sensors. By using random forests to generate a measure of each sensorâs predictive value, and financial cost as a measure of each sensorâs cost, the results show that these environmental sensors are useful predictors of energy use, though the optimal sets vary substantially with the constraint parameters. Furthermore, valuable yet expen- sive sensors such as CO2 are often not chosen in the opti- mal set, and a proportion of both CO2 and light level can be predicted from the other environmental sensors used in the study.},

  abstract                 = {The treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) has undergone significant developments in recent years. The availability of the novel agents thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide has expanded treatment options and has improved the outcome of patients with MM. Following the introduction of these agents in the relapsed/refractory setting, they are also undergoing investigation in the initial treatment of MM. A number of phase III trials have demonstrated the efficacy of novel agent combinations in the transplant and nontransplant settings, and based on these results standard induction regimens are being challenged and replaced. In the transplant setting, a number of newer induction regimens are now available that have been shown to be superior to the vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone regimen. Similarly, in the front-line treatment of patients not eligible for transplantation, regimens incorporating novel agents have been found to be superior to the traditional melphalan plus prednisone regimen. Importantly, some of the novel agents appear to be active in patients with high-risk disease, such as adverse cytogenetic features, and certain comorbidities, such as renal impairment. This review presents an overview of the most recent data with these novel agents and summarizes European treatment practices incorporating the novel agents.},

In the evaluation mode, only the main electric entrance of the house is monitored, and the electric signal is analyzed to disaggregate the total energy consumption. The errors in estimating the energy shares of three major end uses (water heater, baseboard heater and refrigerator) are less than 10{\%} for most evaluation scenarios.},

  abstract                 = {The first requirement for any intelligent household energy management system is to accurately measure home energy use. Whole-home energy measurement is cheap and easy to set up because it requires only one sensor where the home connects to the power grid. The collected data can provide useful information for large appliances. However, the only way to monitor smaller devices' energy use is to install an energy meter on every device. This creates a detailed picture of household energy consumption but requires much additional hardwareâone meter per device in the home. An alternative, more practical, approach to monitor household energy use includes small devices by using circuit-level power measurements. Two proposed algorithms disaggregate the circuit-level data into device-level estimates. An evaluation of these algorithms produced an average error of less than 5.35 percent for each device. So, they enable the development of highly intelligent automated energy management systems.},

The account presented here suggests that memories are first stored via synaptic changes in the hippocampal system, that these changes support reinstatement of recent memories in the neocortex, that neocortical synapses change a little on each reinstatement, and that remote memory is based on accumulated neocortical changes. Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences. The hippocampal system permits rapid learning of new items without disrupting this structure, and reinstatement of new memories interleaves them with others to integrate them into structured neocortical memory systems.},

  abstract                 = {With the latest high-end computing nodes combining shared-memory multiprocessing with hardware multithreading, new scheduling policies are necessary for workloads consisting of multithreaded applications. The use of hybrid multiprocessors presents schedulers with the problem of job pairing, i.e. deciding which specific jobs can share each processor with minimum performance penalty, by running on different execution contexts. Therefore, scheduling policies are expected to decide not only which job mix will execute simultaneously across the processors, but also which jobs can be combined within each processor.This paper addresses the problem by introducing new scheduling policies that use run-time performance information to identify the best mix of threads to run across processors and within each processor. Scheduling of threads across processors is driven by the memory bandwidth utilization of the threads, whereas scheduling of threads within processors is driven by one of three metrics: bus transaction rate per thread, stall cycle rate per thread, or outermost level cache miss rate per thread. We have implemented and experimentally evaluated these policies on a real multiprocessor server with Intel Hyperthreaded processors.The policy using bus transaction rate for thread pairing achieves an average 13.4{\%} and a maximum 28.7{\%} performance improvement over the Linux scheduler. The policy using stall cycle rate for thread pairing achieves an average 9.5{\%} and a maximum 18.8{\%} performance improvement. The average and maximum performance gains of the policy using cache miss rate for thread pairing are 7.2{\%} and 23.6{\%} respectively.},

  abstract                 = {Data center power consumption is growing to unprecedented levels: the EPA estimates U.S. data centers will consume 100 billion kilowatt hours annually by 2011. Much of this energy is wasted in idle systems: in typical deployments, server utilization is below 30{\%}, but idle servers still consume 60{\%} of their peak power draw. Typical idle periods though frequent--last seconds or less, confounding simple energy-conservation approaches. In this paper, we propose PowerNap, an energy-conservation approach where the entire system transitions rapidly between a high-performance active state and a near-zero-power idle state in response to instantaneous load. Rather than requiring fine-grained power-performance states and complex load-proportional operation from each system component, PowerNap instead calls for minimizing idle power and transition time, which are simpler optimization goals. Based on the PowerNap concept, we develop requirements and outline mechanisms to eliminate idle power waste in enterprise blade servers. Because PowerNap operates in low-efficiency regions of current blade center power supplies, we introduce the Redundant Array for Inexpensive Load Sharing (RAILS), a power provisioning approach that provides high conversion efficiency across the entire range of PowerNap's power demands. Using utilization traces collected from enterprise-scale commercial deployments, we demonstrate that, together, PowerNap and RAILS reduce average server power consumption by 74{\%}.},

This paper investigates the cross-effects between tasks running on a multicore system, considering memory contention and the technical constraint of chip-wide frequency and voltage settings. We make the following contributions: 1) We identify the memory characteristics of tasks and sort core-specific runqueues to allow a co-scheduling of tasks with minimal energy delay product. 2) According to the memory characteristics of the workload, we set the frequency for individual chips so that the delay is only marginal. Our evaluation with a Linux implementation running on an Intel quad-core shows that memory-aware scheduling can reduce EDP considerably.},

  abstract                 = {The introduction of electricity monitors (in-home displays; IHDs), which show accurate and up-to-the-minute energy usage, is expected to lead to reduction in consumption. Studies of feedback on domestic electricity use have generally supported this view. However, such studies also demonstrate wide variation between households. Examining the heterogeneity of responses is essential for understanding the actual and potential effectiveness of IHDs and in order to target interventions effectively. To explore differences between households' responses to IHDs, we conducted a qualitative study with 21 households who had an IHD for more than six months. Of the 21, only four households continued to refer to the IHD and the findings suggest that attempts to reduce energy consumption were situated in wider social and physical contexts. Further, the participants demonstrated energy saving behaviour before and outside of IHD usage. The patterns of energy behaviours and attempts at electricity conservation could best be understood by categorising the households into three types: the Monitor Enthusiasts (20{\%}), the Aspiring Energy Savers (60{\%}) and the Energy Non-Engaged (20{\%}). The factors of importance in energy behaviour differed between the categories. Financial savings contributed to efforts to reduce energy use but only up to boundaries which varied considerably between households. Social practices and social relationships appeared to constrain what actions households were prepared to undertake, illuminating aspects of inter-household variation. Within the household, all energy users were not equal and we found that women were particularly influential on energy use through their primary responsibility for domestic labour on behalf of the household. The implications of the findings for environmental campaigning are discussed.},

Storage uses a significant fraction of the power budget and there are no widely deployed power-saving solutions for enterprise storage systems. The traditional view is that enterprise workloads make spinning disks down ineffective because idle periods are too short. We analyzed block-level traces from 36 volumes in an enterprise data center for one week and concluded that significant idle periods exist, and that they can be further increased by modifying the read/write patterns using write off-loading. Write off-loading allows write requests on spun-down disks to be temporarily redirected to persistent storage elsewhere in the data center. The key challenge is doing this transparently and efficiently at the block level, without sacrificing consistency or failure resilience. We describe our write off-loading design and implementation that achieves these goals. We evaluate it by replaying portions of our traces on a rack-based testbed. Results show that just spinning disks down when idle saves 28--36{\&}percnt; of energy, and write off-loading further increases the savings to 45--60{\&}percnt;.},

As a single hand-held RGB camera flies over a static scene, we estimate detailed textured depth maps at selected keyframes to produce a surface patchwork with millions of vertices. We use the hundreds of images available in a video stream to improve the quality of a simple photometric data term, and minimise a global spatially regularised energy functional in a novel non-convex optimisation framework. Interleaved, we track the camera's 6DOF motion precisely by frame-rate whole image alignment against the entire dense model. Our algorithms are highly parallelisable throughout and DTAM achieves real-time performance using current commodity GPU hardware. We demonstrate that a dense model permits superior tracking performance under rapid motion compared to a state of the art method using features; and also show the additional usefulness of the dense model for real-time scene interaction in a physics-enhanced augmented reality application.},

  abstract                 = {Nowadays, data centers are consuming a lot of energy but not in an efficient fashion. Much of energy is wasted. There are several types of energy waste at different levels including infrastructure-, machine- and system-level waste. The former two levels have been improved significantly in the last few years, however, few efforts have been put on the last level, especially the resource waste caused by failures in a data center. In this paper, we attack the problem proactively by leveraging a reputation-based resource selection scheme to reduce the number of resubmissions of tasks, resulting from the failure during the course of their execution. To capture the characteristics of resources, we introduce Opera, an OPEn ReputAtion model. Opera characterizes itself with two important novelties. One is that Opera employs a vector, instead of a single value, to represent the reputation of a resource (entity) in order to capture its heterogeneity in different points of view. The other novelty of Opera is introducing the just-in-time feature that represents the real-time system status, which, to our knowledge, has never been considered in conventional reputation systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Opera, we have integrated and implemented the Opera trust model with the scheduler in Hadoop, a popular, data intensive open source framework. The experimental results showed that Opera enabled the scheduler to select appropriate nodes to assign tasks based on different criteria, and this helped reduce not only the number of re-executed tasks but also the execution time of Hadoop's jobs under the presence of failures and heavy workload up to 59{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively. 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract                 = {The goal of analyzing a time series database is to find whether and how frequent a periodic pattern is repeated within the series. Periodic pattern mining is the problem that regards temporal regularity. However, most of the existing algorithms have a major limitation in mining interesting patterns of users interest, that is, they can mine patterns of specific length with all the events sequentially one after another in exact positions within this pattern. Though there are certain scenarios where a pattern can be flexible, that is, it may be interesting and can be mined by neglecting any number of unimportant events in between important events with variable length of the pattern. Moreover, existing algorithms can detect only specific type of periodicity in various time series databases and require the interaction from user to determine periodicity. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm for the periodic pattern mining in time series databases which does not rely on the user for the period value or period type of the pattern and can detect all types of periodic patterns at the same time, indeed these flexibilities are missing in existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm facilitates the user to generate different kinds of patterns by skipping intermediate events in a time series database and find out the periodicity of the patterns within the database. It is an improvement over the generating pattern using suffix tree, because suffix tree based algorithms have weakness in this particular area of pattern generation. Comparing with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves generating different kinds of interesting patterns and detects whether the generated pattern is periodic or not. We have tested the performance of our algorithm on both synthetic and real life data from different domains and found a large number of interesting event sequences which were missing in existing algorithms and the proposed algorithm was efficient enough in generating and detecting periodicity of flexible patterns on both types of data.},

Work performed by the authors and other researchers has shown that individual loads can be detected and separated from rapid sampling of power at a single point serving a number of pieces of equipment, for example the electrical service entrance for an entire house or all of the central space-conditioning equipment in a commercial building. This technique has worked well in tests in houses but faces more difficult challenges in commercial buildings. We present our results for this centralized or non-intrusive load monitoring technique, applied to the space-conditioning equipment in an office/laboratory building in which equipment start-up and shut-down was centrally observed and analyzed on the basis of changes in steady-state power. We further describe our enhanced technique for distinguishing loads by matching start-up transients to known patterns, and present laboratory tests of fully automated detection hardware and software.},

The paper reviews evaluation methods used internationally for both building thermal efficiency and building energy labelling and presents results from two discrete studies in South Australia on monitoring actual household energy consumption. In order to investigate the occupancy effect on household energy, monitored energy data collected from two different housing developments in South Australia were examined. The energy ratings for these homes are compliant with the national agreed protocols for thermal performance modelling of dwellings, where one set of homes is a group occupied by higher socio-economic groups and the other is low income public housing in a colder climate region with much poorer home energy ratings. The wide variation of actual household energy for the homes that have relatively similar thermal envelopes indicates a lack of meaningful use for actual household energy in disclosure of house energy performance. Therefore, it is argued that thermal modelling software used to rate homes appears a more useful application of a system of disclosure of energy performance than the use of energy bills. },

  abstract                 = {MapReduce has been very successful in implementing large-scale data-intensive applications. Because of its simple programming model, MapReduce has also begun being utilized as a programming tool for more general distributed and parallel applications, e.g., HPC applications. However, its applicability is limited due to relatively inefficient runtime performance and hence insufficient support for flexible workflow. In particular, the performance problem is not negligible in iterative MapReduce applications. On the other hand, today, HPC community is going to be able to utilize very fast and energy-efficient Solid State Drives (SSDs) with 10 Gbit/sec-class read/write performance. This fact leads us to the possibility to develop "High-Performance MapReduce", so called. From this perspective, we have been developing a new MapReduce framework called "SSS" based on distributed key-value store (KVS). In this paper, we first discuss the limitations of existing MapReduce implementations and present the design and implementation of SSS. Although our implementation of SSS is still in a prototype stage, we conduct two benchmarks for comparing the performance of SSS and Hadoop. The results indicate that SSS performs 1-10 times faster than Hadoop. 2010 IEEE.},

One approach in the domestic sector is to improve consumer understanding of how much energy is consumed by each of their household appliances. This empowers consumers to make educated decisions on how they can change their lifestyle in an effort to reduce their energy consumption. This report investigates how total household energy consumption can be disaggregated into individual appliances using low granularity data collected from a single point of measurement, such as a smart meter. First, this work discusses how this problem can be solved using combinatorial optimisation. Second, a novel approach is introduced using hidden Markov models to model each appliance. We show through empirical evaluation that our implementation of the hidden Markov model approach outperforms the combinatorial optimisation method. Our future work is then outlined to show how we plan to better model domestic appliances and therefore improve the accuracy of our approach.},

  abstract                 = {We present the design, development, and evaluation of an end-user installable, whole house power consumption sensing system capable of gathering accurate real-time power use that does not require installing a current transformer around the electrical feeds in a home. Rather, our sensor system offers contactless operation by simply placing it on the outside of the breaker panel in a home. Although there are a number of existing commercial systems for gathering energy use in a home, almost none can easily and safely be installed by a homeowner (especially for homes in the U.S.). Our approach leverages advances in magnetoresistive materials and circuit design to allow contactless operation by reliably sensing the magnetic field induced by the 60 Hz current and a closed loop circuit allows us to precisely infer the power consumption in real-time. The contribution of this work is an enabling technology for researchers in the fields of Ubiquitous Computing and Human-Computer Interaction wanting to conduct practical large-scale deployments of end-user-deployable energy monitoring applications. We discuss the technical details, the iterative design, and end-user evaluations of our sensing approach.},

The primary feature used for unsupervised learning relates to abrupt transitions or magnitude changes in the power waveform. The method consists of a sequence of procedures for appliance signature identification, and disaggregation using hidden Markov modeling (HMM), and residual analysis. The key contributions are (a) a novel 'segmented' application of the Viterbi algorithm for sequence decoding with the HMM, (b) details of establishing observation and state transition probabilities for the HMM, and (c) procedures for careful handling of low power signatures. Results show that the method is effective for magnitude-based disaggregation, and provide insights for a more complete solution.},

Although the basic control flow of this framework has existed in parallel SQL database management systems (DBMS) for over 20 years, some have called MR a dramatically new computing model [8, 17]. In this paper, we describe and compare both paradigms. Furthermore, we evaluate both kinds of systems in terms of performance and development complexity. To this end, we define a benchmark consisting of a collection of tasks that we have run on an open source version of MR as well as on two parallel DBMSs. For each task, we measure each system's performance for various degrees of parallelism on a cluster of 100 nodes. Our results reveal some interesting trade-offs. Although the process to load data into and tune the execution of parallel DBMSs took much longer than the MR system, the observed performance of these DBMSs was strikingly better. We speculate about the causes of the dramatic performance difference and consider implementation concepts that future systems should take from both kinds of architectures.},

  abstract                 = {Historically, the performance and purchase price of enterprise information systems have been the key
arguments in purchasing decisions. With rising energy costs and increasing power use due to the ever-
growing demand for compute capacity (servers, storage, networks etc.), electricity bills have become
a significant expense for todays data centers. In the very near future, energy efficiency is expected
to be one of the key purchasing arguments. Having realized this trend, the Transaction Processing
Performance Council has developed the TPC-Energy specification. It defines a standard methodology
for measuring, reporting and fairly comparing power consumption of enterprise information systems.
Wide industry adaption of TPC-Energy requires a large body of benchmark publications across multiple
software and hardware platforms, which could take several years. Meanwhile, we believe that analytical
power estimates based on nameplate power is a useful tool for estimating power consumption of TPC
benchmark configurations as well as enterprise information systems. This paper presents enhancements
to previously published energy estimation models based on the TPC-C and TPC-H benchmarks from the
same authors and a new model, based on the TPC-E benchmark. The models can be applied to estimate
power consumption of enterprise OLTP and Decision Support systems.},

Several studies project that the Arctic Ocean may become seasonally ice-free by the year 2040 or even earlier. Putting this into perspective requires information on the history of Arctic sea-ice conditions through the geologic past. This information can be provided by proxy records from the Arctic Ocean floor and from the surrounding coasts. Although existing records are far from complete, they indicate that sea ice became a feature of the Arctic by 47Â Ma, following a pronounced decline in atmospheric pCO2 after the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Optimum, and consistently covered at least part of the Arctic Ocean for no less than the last 13-14 million years. Ice was apparently most widespread during the last 2-3 million years, in accordance with Earth's overall cooler climate. Nevertheless, episodes of considerably reduced sea ice or even seasonally ice-free conditions occurred during warmer periods linked to orbital variations. The last low-ice event related to orbital forcing (high insolation) was in the early Holocene, after which the northern high latitudes cooled overall, with some superimposed shorter-term (multidecadal to millennial-scale) and lower-magnitude variability. The current reduction in Arctic ice cover started in the late 19th century, consistent with the rapidly warming climate, and became very pronounced over the last three decades. This ice loss appears to be unmatched over at least the last few thousand years and unexplainable by any of the known natural variabilities.</p>},

  abstract                 = {The Non-Intrusive Load Monitor (NILM) is a device that utilizes voltage and current measurements to monitor an entire system from a single reference point. The NILM and associated software convert the V/I signal to spectral power envelopes that can be searched to determine when a transient occurs. The identification of this signal can then be determined by an expert classifier and a series of these classifications can be used to diagnose system failures or improper operation. Current NILM research conducted at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems (LEES) is exploring the application and expansion of NILM technology for the use of monitoring shipboard systems. This thesis presents the ginzu application that implements a detect-classify-verify loop that locates the indexes of transients, identifies them using a decision-tree based expert classifier, and then generates a summary event file containing relevant information. The ginzu application provides a command-line interface between streaming preprocessed power data (PREP) and an included graphical user interface. This software was developed using thousands of hours of archived data from the Coast Guard Cutters ESCANABA (WMEC-907) and SENECA (WMEC-906). A validation of software effectiveness was conducted as the software was installed onboard ESCANABA.},

  abstract                 = {Under European Directives, all member states are required to install 'intelligent metering systems' - smart meters - to at least 80{\%} of domestic electricity consumers by 2020. The UK Government has opted for a more challenging programme, with plans for energy suppliers to install smart electricity and gas meters in all homes and smaller non-domestic premises in Great Britain by 2019. We welcome the introduction of smart meters, but have concerns over the way the programme has been planned. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (the Department) estimates that the smart meters programme will cost some Â£11.7 billion. This is a large complex programme requiring replacing around 53 million gas and electricity meters with significant uncertainties over the estimated costs and benefits involved.

In particular, it is far from certain that all consumers will benefit from the regulatory requirement placed on suppliers to install smart meters in their homes. We recognise however that the Department will work to ensure that consumers do benefit from being able to monitor their energy costs. The costs of installing smart meters will be borne by consumers through their energy bills, but many of the benefits accrue in the first instance to energy suppliers. No transparent mechanism presently exists for ensuring savings to the supplier are passed on to consumers, and the track record of energy companies to date does not inspire confidence that this will happen.

The Department has acknowledged that it is accountable for delivering the programme, keeping the costs down and ensuring that consumers benefit through reduced bills from the lower costs borne by suppliers and reduced energy use. The Department insists that suppliers are best placed to deliver the programme and that competition between energy suppliers is the best way to ensure consumers benefit from suppliers' savings. We are concerned, however, that past performance suggests that competition does not work effectively in this market and should not be relied on to keep prices low.

There remain significant uncertainties in a number of key areas in the programme. Consumers may not be willing to cooperate with the installation of smart meters: the communications programme which is promised for 2012 is therefore absolutely vital to help consumers use smart meters to reduce consumption. Significant practical difficulties may arise in procuring and installing the required data communications service before the planned roll-out of smart meters in 2014 (at a projected cost of Â£3 billion). The Department needs to address remaining uncertainties by conducting proper trials to identify and manage the risks associated with an IT project involving such a substantial amount of money which is financed by individuals as consumers.

The Department needs to ensure that the vulnerable, those on low incomes and those who use prepayment meters also benefit from smart meters. It would be unacceptable if these consumers bore the costs of smart meters through higher charges without getting a share of the potential benefits. The Government must put in place measures to ensure vulnerable people are not readily disconnected if they fall behind with payments.

There are issues around cyber security which need to be addressed if confidence in this new technology is to be gained by the population who are expected to have smart meters in their home and pay for them.

On the basis of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General,[1] we took evidence from the Department on preparations for the roll-out of smart meters, including the procurement of the Data Communications Service.},

This is in contrast to intrusive monitoring where end use devices are sensed. Building on techniques of previous works, it will be shown that NILM can be implemented on currently available commercial devices and provide meaningful feedback both to the user and supplying utility. Limitations of inexpensive commercial devices such as resolution and measurement accuracy are a challenge. An algorithm currently under development, specifically developed for the low resolution of inexpensive commercial sensor packages, will be discussed and demonstrated. This information can then be used to verify the effectiveness of various smart grid initiatives in addition to other energy saving protocols such as weather proofing and energy efficient appliances. In addition, this information can be used to select devices for distributed control by analyzing not only the type of device but also the real world operating characteristics.},

  abstract                 = {Given a familiar object extracted from its surroundings, we humans have little difficulty in recognizing it irrespective of its size, position and orientation in our field of view. Changes in lighting and the effects of perspective also pose no problems. How do we achieve this, and more importantly, how can we get a computer to do this? One very promising approach is to find mathematical functions of an object's image, or of an object's 3D description, that are invariant to the transformations caused by the object's motion. This book is devoted to the theory and practice of such invariant image features, so-called image invariants, for planar objects. It gives a comprehensive summary of the field, discussing methods for recognizing both occluded and partially occluded objects, and also contains a definitive treatmentof moment invariants and a tutorial introduction to algebraic invariants, which are fundamental to affine moment invariants and to many projective invariants. A number of novel invariant functions are presented and the results of numerous experiments investigating the stability of new and old invariants are discussed. The main conclusion is that moment invariants are very effective, both for partially occluded objects and for recognizing objects in grey-level images.},

million homes and smaller businesses in Britain. These smart meters, with in-home-displays,
are intended to allow consumers to see and adjust in real time what energy they are using.
Ofgem considers that smart metering could âtransform how energy markets operateâ. The
Government estimates that over the next 20 years, the rollout of smart meters will deliver
over Â£7 billion net benefits to consumers, energy suppliers and networks.
Since an original July 2010 Prospectus a large range of documentation has been issued by
DECC and Ofgem on the rollout programme, most recently an April 2012 update, along with
a new range of consultation documents and government responses to issues raised.
Issues of concern include the extent to which smart meters will be mandated, consumer
protection during the installation process, and concerns about privacy and access to smart
metering data. It has been decided for example that suppliersâ codes of practice should ban
verbal marketing activity without prior consent during installations, with a complete ban on
completing any sales. It is proposed that in general, energy suppliers should be able to
access consumption data on a monthly basis, with a clear consumer opt-out for daily access
and an opt-in for more frequent access.
The National Audit Office (NAO) and the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) have raised
concerns about the ambition of the programme, its risks and the extent of the potential
benefits to consumers. The PAC considers the challenges associated with roll-out âhugeâ.},

The implementation of classification capability in future transient recorders will enable such features as selective storage of transient data (to better utilize limited storage media) and automated reporting of disturbances to central control facilities. The wavelet transform provides an effective and efficient means of decomposing voltage and current signals of power system transients to detectable and discriminant features. Similarities of power system transients to wide-band signals in other domains, the simultaneous presence of a resonant frequency, its harmonics, and impulse (high-frequency, time-localized) components, make this technique extendible to other classification systems. The classification algorithm uses statistical pattern recognition on features derived from the extreme representation of the transient waveform after processing the transient waveform by a non-orthogonal, quadratic spline wavelet. Training and classification testing use simulated waveforms of a 200 mile, three-phase transmission line produced by the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). A simple Bayesian classifier identifies an unknown transient waveform as a capacitor switching or fault transient, and locates the point of disturbance from one of two possible locations on the transmission line. Due to the effectiveness of the wavelet transform preprocessing, the classification system currently performs at 100 percent accuracy on four transient classes.},

The authors propose a formal description of the FSM and its output, using a regular phrase-structured grammar. This description is associated with a cost measuring its information content. The authors then state the inference problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with an objective function define as the cost of the description of the FSM and its output. A heuristic algorithm is proposed which processes the output âon lineâ and yields a local minimum of the authors' criterion. At each step (i.e. as new data is observed and processed), the procedure searches locally through the space of non-probabilistic FSMs, i.e., the transitions are initially regarded as being only present or absent. When a non-probabilistic model has been generated, the transition probabilities are determined from their relative frequencies given the behavior indicated by the data. This yields maximum likelihood estimates of the probabilities. The costs of the obtained probabilistic FSMs are then computed, and the K minimum cost FSMs are kept as starting points for the next step search. At each step, the generation of the FSMs is done via a local search through the neighborhoods of the K best FSMs obtained at the previous step. This algorithm is compared with similar algorithms proposed previously, and tested on a range of examples. It is found to work for a wider range of FSMs than the previous methods, and it is much more practical for large problems than previously proposed exhaustive search techniques},

  abstract                 = {Sensing, monitoring and actuating systems are expected to play a key role in reducing buildings overall energy consumption. Leveraging sensor systems to support energy efficiency in buildings poses novel research challenges in monitoring space usage, controlling devices, interfacing with smart energy meters and communicating with the energy grid. In the attempt of reducing electricity consumption in buildings, identifying individual sources of energy consumption is key to generate energy awareness and improve efficiency of available energy resources usage. Previous work studied several non-intrusive load monitoring techniques to classify appliances; however, the literature lacks of an comprehensive system that can be easily installed in existing buildings to empower users profiling, benchmarking and recognizing loads in real-time. This has been a major reason holding back the practice adoption of load monitoring techniques. In this paper we present RECAP: RECognition of electrical Appliances and Profiling in real-time. RECAP uses a single wireless energy monitoring sensor easily clipped to the main electrical unit. The energy monitoring unit transmits energy data wirelessly to a local machine for data processing and storage. The RECAP system consists of three parts: (1) Guiding the user for profiling electrical appliances within premises and generating a database of unique appliance signatures; (2) Using those signatures to train an artificial neural network that is then employed to recognize appliance activities (3) Providing a Load descriptor to allow peer appliance benchmarking. RECAP addresses the need of an integrated and intuitive tool to empower building owners with energy awareness. Enabling real-time appliance recognition is a stepping-stone towards reducing energy consumption and allowing a number of major applications including load-shifting techniques, energy expenditure breakdown per appliance, detection of power hungry and faulty appliances, and recogn- - ition of occupant activity. This paper describes the system design and performance evaluation in domestic environment.},

  abstract                 = {This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Federated Array of Bricks (FAB), a distributed disk array that provides the reliability of traditional enterprise arrays with lower cost and better scalability. FAB is built from a collection of bricks, small storage appliances containing commodity disks, CPU, NVRAM, and network interface cards. FAB deploys a new majority-voting-based algorithm to replicate or erasure-code logical blocks across bricks and a reconfiguration algorithm to move data in the background when bricks are added or decommissioned. We argue that voting is practical and necessary for reliable, high-throughput storage systems such as FAB. We have implemented a FAB prototype on a 22-node Linux cluster. This prototype sustains 85MB/second of throughput for a database workload, and 270MB/second for a bulk-read workload. In addition, it can outperform traditional master-slave replication through performance decoupling and can handle brick failures and recoveries smoothly without disturbing client requests.},

Moreover, the recent advances in Web technology has made it easy for any user to provide and consume content of any form. This has called for a paradigm shift in the computing architecture and large scale data processing mechanisms. Cloud computing is associated with a new paradigm for the provision of computing infrastructure. This paradigm shifts the location of this infrastructure to the network to reduce the costs associated with the management of hardware and software resources. This paper gives a comprehensive survey of numerous approaches and mechanisms of deploying data-intensive applications in the cloud which are gaining a lot of momentum in both research and industrial communities. We analyze the various design decisions of each approach and its suitability to support certain classes of applications and end-users. A discussion of some open issues and future challenges pertaining to scalability, consistency, economical processing of large scale data on the cloud is provided. We highlight the characteristics of the best candidate classes of applications that can be deployed in the cloud.},

Since Online Services application loads are unpredictable, datacenter operators often conservatively provision for maximum power utilization by characterizing workloads for peak load performance. In contrast, we aim to optimize the service capacity per total cost of ownership (TCO) of an Online Service datacenter deployment by characterizing the energy-delay properties of large scale datacenter workloads. We show that the peak load performance is not the energy efficient point of operation for most applications. We choose two industry-strength workloads (Internet Search and D-Process) and analyze their energy-delay behavior under varying loads. We then calculate the optimal operating point for the specific large-scale application and provision datacenter energy and capacity based on the energy-delay curves. In contrast to workload-based peak power provisioning, we show a 7{\%} benefit in Service Capacity-per-TCO-dollar for the energy-delay characterization methodology in our cost analysis for Online Services Applications.},

Here, we pursue both topics in examining how the Hawthorne effect emerges in a large field experiment focused on residential consumers' electricity use. These consumers received five postcards notifying, and then reminding, them of their participation in a study of household electricity use. We found evidence for a Hawthorne (study participation) effect, seen in a reduction of their electricity use--even though they received no information, instruction, or incentives to change. Responses to a follow-up survey suggested that the effect reflected heightened awareness of energy consumption. Consistent with that interpretation, the treatment effect vanished when the intervention ended.},

In order for this energy turnaround' to take place, however, reducing residential energy consumption must go beyond using energy-efficient devices: More sustainable behaviour and lifestyles are essential parts of future energy aware' living. Addressing this issue from an HCI perspective, this paper presents the results of a 3-year research project dealing with the co-design and appropriation of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that has been rolled out in a living lab setting with seven households for a period of 18 months. Our HEMS is inspired by feedback systems in Sustainable Interaction Design and allows the monitoring of energy consumption in real-time. In contrast to existing research mainly focusing on how technology can persuade people to consume less energy ( what technology does to people'), our study focuses on the appropriation of energy feedback systems ( what people do with technology') and how newly developed practices can become a resource for future technology design. Therefore, we deliberately followed an open research design. In keeping with this approach, our study uncovers various responses, practices and obstacles of HEMS use. We show that HEMS use is characterized by a number of different features. Recognizing the distinctive patterns of technology use in the different households and the evolutionary character of that use within the households, we conclude with a discussion of these patterns in relation to existing research and their meaning for the design of future HEMSs.},

We compared PreHeat's prediction algorithm with a static program over an average 61 days per house, alternating days between these conditions, and measuring actual gas consumption and occupancy. In UK homes PreHeat both saved gas and reduced MissTime (the time that the house was occupied but not warm). In US homes, PreHeat decreased MissTime by a factor of 6-12, while consuming a similar amount of gas. In summary, PreHeat enables more efficient heating while removing the need for users to program thermostat schedules.},

This article evaluates the file system's impact on energy consumption and performance. We studied several popular Linux file systems, with various mount and format options, using the FileBench workload generator to emulate four server workloads: Web, database, mail, and fileserver, on two different hardware configurations. The file system design, implementation, and available features have a significant effect on CPU/disk utilization, and hence on performance and power. We discovered that default file system options are often suboptimal, and even poor. In this article we show that a careful matching of expected workloads and hardware configuration to a single software configurationâthe file systemâcan improve power-performance efficiency by a factor ranging from 1.05 to 9.4 times.},

The power and performance predictions from the simulated model of a PowerPC 405GP (or simply 405GP) were validated against a 405GP-based evaluation board instrumented for power measurements using 42 application/dataset combinations from the EEMBC benchmark suite. The average performance and energy-prediction errors were 0.6{\%} and 4.1{\%}, respectively. In addition to describing Tempo, we show examples of how well it can predict the runtime power consumption of a 405GP microprocessor during application execution.},

In this book Dr Shapiro presents a new computer vision framework for interpreting time-varying imagery. This is an important task, since movement reveals valuable information about the environment. The fully-automated system operates on long, monocular image sequences containing multiple, independently-moving objects, and demonstrates the practical feasibility of recovering scene structure and motion in a bottom-up fashion. Real and synthetic examples are given throughout, with particular emphasis on image coding applications. Novel theory is derived in the context of the affine camera, a generalisation of the familiar scaled orthographic model. Analysis proceeds by tracking 'corner features' through successive frames and grouping the resulting trajectories into rigid objects using new clustering and outlier rejection techniques. The three-dimensional motion parameters are then computed via affine epipolar geometry, and affine structure is used to generate alternative views of the object and fill in partial views. The use of all available features (over multiple frames) and the incorporation of statistical noise properties substantially improves existing algorithms, giving greater reliability and reduced noise sensitivity.},

There are numerous methods that limit the impact of both factors, such as expanding the use of renewable energy or participating in automated demand-response programs. To take advantage of these methods, servers and applications must gracefully handle intermittent constraints in their power supply. In this paper, we propose blinking---metered transitions between a high-power active state and a low-power inactive state---as the primary abstraction for conforming to intermittent power constraints. We design Blink, an application-independent hardware-software platform for developing and evaluating blinking applications, and define multiple types of blinking policies. We then use Blink to design BlinkCache, a blinking version of memcached, to demonstrate the effect of blinking on an example application. Our results show that a load-proportional blinking policy combines the advantages of both activation and synchronous blinking for realistic Zipf-like popularity distributions and wind/solar power signals by achieving near optimal hit rates (within 15{\%} of an activation policy), while also providing fairer access to the cache (within 2{\%} of a syn- chronous policy) for equally popular objects.},

A three-phase balanced induction motor is assumed. Measurements of the stator currents and voltages are required for the identification procedure, but no measurements from the motor shaft are needed. The first method presented applies simple models with limited temporal domains of validity and obtains parameter estimates by extrapolating the model error bias to zero. This method does not minimize any specific error criterion and is presented as a means of finding a good initial guess for a conventional iterative maximum-likelihood or least-squares estimator. The second method presented minimizes equation errors in the induction motor model in the least-square sense using a Levenburg-Marquardt iteration. The third identification method is a continuation of the Levenburg-Marquardt method, motivated by observed properties of some pathological loss functions. The third method minimizes errors in the observations in the least-squared sense and is, therefore, a maximum-likelihood estimator under appropriate conditions of normality. The performance of the identification schemes is demonstrated with both simulated and measured data, and parameters obtained using the methods are compared with parameters obtained from standard tests},

  abstract                 = {Apache Hadoop is a framework for managing large scale storage based datacenters whose primary job is to deliver data to clients. In such systems, the primary job is to associate each data request to a specific data replica among many available replicas. This assignment impacts the workload and power distribution across the storage servers. In this paper, we explore thermal and power aware task scheduling for Hadoop based storage centric datacenters. In order to maintain the reliability of datacenters, we would like to make sure that each node in the datacenter operates at a temperature below a certain temperature threshold. At the same time, we would like to minimize the total power consumption in the air conditioning (A/C) system that provides the cooling for maintaining the temperature. We formulate the resultant optimization problem as an Integer Linear Programming problem and develop minimum cost flow based heuristic to solve the problem. The experimental result shows that, our method forces the A/C system to output air temperature only 0.69K lower on average compared to the optimal ILP solution. However, the runtime of our method is only 1{\%}â2.5{\%} of the runtime using ILP solver. Also, random selection of data replica for each data request results in the required A/C output air temperature to be 6.35K lower than our method, which forces the A/C system to work harder.},

This task is particularly important for matching images across visual domains, such as photos taken over different seasons or lighting conditions, paintings, hand-drawn sketches, etc. We propose a surprisingly simple method that estimates the relative importance of different features in a query image based on the notion of "data-driven uniqueness". We employ standard tools from discriminative object detection in a novel way, yielding a generic approach that does not depend on a particular image representation or a specific visual domain. Our approach shows good performance on a number of difficult cross-domain visual tasks e.g., matching paintings or sketches to real photographs. The method also allows us to demonstrate novel applications such as Internet re-photography, and painting2gps. While at present the technique is too computationally intensive to be practical for interactive image retrieval, we hope that some of the ideas will eventually become applicable to that domain as well.},

Field tests were performed at a 160Â MW coal-fired unit to investigate the relationships between process controllable variables, and optimization targets and constraints. Based on the test data, a modified on-line support vector regression model was proposed for characteristic function approximation, in which the model parameters can be continuously adapted for changes in coal quality and other conditions of plant equipment. The optimization scheme was implemented by a genetic algorithm in two stages. Firstly, the multi-objective combustion optimization problem was solved to achieve an optimal Pareto front, which contains optimal solutions for lowest unit heat rate and lowest NOx emissions. Secondly, best operating settings for the boiler, and SCR system and air preheater were obtained for lowest operating cost under the constraints of NOx emissions limit and air preheater ammonium bisulfate deposition depth.</p>},

Conclusions drawn from our modeling and experimentation are presented here, with emphasis given to those results bearing directly on the character of programs to retrofit the national housing stock.<br/>Photographs of the site, of building defects, and of our retrofits are included, as well as a selection of graphical displays of data, each a snapshot of a kind of analysis we have found useful and are prepared to recommend to others who wish to help develop an understanding of how houses work.<br/>Lists are included both of the program's reports and publications and of the people who have contributed to the Twin Rivers program since its inception.</p>},

This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450â600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the âdust bowlâ era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4â1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6â1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding â1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational "real world" settings. We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively. We support this claim by identifying challenges particular to network intrusion detection, and provide a set of guidelines meant to strengthen future research on anomaly detection.},

  abstract                 = {This paper proposes a neural-network (NN)-based approach to nonintrusive harmonic source identification. In this approach, NNs are trained to extract important features from the input current waveform to uniquely identify various types of devices using their distinct harmonic "signatures". Such automated, noninvasive device identification will be critical in future power-quality monitoring and enhancement systems. Several NN-based classification models including multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) network, and support vector machines (SVM) with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels were developed for signature extraction and device identification. These models were trained and tested using spike train data gathered from the Fourier analysis of the input current waveform in the presence of multiple devices. The performance of these models was compared in terms of their accuracy, generalization ability, and noise tolerance limits. The results showed that MLPs and SVM were both able to determine the presence of devices based on their harmonic signatures with high accuracy. MLP was found to be the best signature identification method because of its low computational requirements and ability to extract the information necessary for highly accurate device identification.},

The study shows that local measurement of variations in active and reactive power is sufficient in most cases to identify an appliance. This measurement must be synchronized with the events. This necessitates a numerical measurement device which can monitor the signal and isolate the times when variations occur. In a second stage, a sorting algorithm identifies the appliance that has operated. An attempt is made to show the feasibility of this device. Test findings secured on site using a test prototype are presented},

  abstract                 = {This paper presents a new nonintrusive appliance load monitoring technique based on the integer programming. Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring is a problem to identify the operating conditions of the electric appliances in a house only by observing the overall load current and voltage. Since the overall load current is expressed as a superposition of each current of the operating appliance, the monitoring problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic programming problem by expressing the operating conditions as integer variables. This problem is solvable with sufficiently small computational burden thanks to the recent development of the commercial software. The proposed method does not require the relearning even when a new appliance is installed in the house. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is applicable to cases that some appliance has multiple modes, and cases that some same-type appliances operate simultaneously. Usefulness of the proposed technique is verified through some experimental results.},

  abstract                 = {Introduction Over the past decade, the mountains of data accumulating within firms - expanding at an annual rate of 30-50{\%} and fueled in part by recent legislation such as SEC Rule 17a-4 mandating the retention of electronic communications (for example, email and instant messaging) in financial services firms for periods of up to three years - has forced information technology (IT) executives to ask how should this data deluge be managed. Intel, whose data warehouse is currently estimated at over 30 petabytes has increased its data storage by an average of 35{\%} annually with the expectation that, if current trends continue, its data center could expand to 165 petabytes by 2014. Yet even as data volumes climb, causing data centers to double in size every other year, an innovation-led drop in annual per-gigabyte storage costs of between 35-45{\%} (see Figure 1) has failed to halt the rise in storage spending. With organizing and utilizing data now seen as one of the most critical issues facing firms worldwide, IT executives note that non-discretionary IT spending - 25{\%} of which covers information management costs and storage infrastructure, in particular - has now reached a point where strategic IT initiatives are at risk. Hence, CIOs have a pressing need to understand the dynamics of information management costs and their ability to control these costs through carefully chosen policies governing data collection and retention. Knowing how these costs behave, CIOs can continue to support the data needs of their firms without limiting their IT goals. To begin this process, we examine a tiered information framework that, by considering the value of information, allows CIOs to comprehend the interplay of market forces that shape information costs. Lastly, we review several challenges posed by our framework that future academic research can help to resolve.},

  abstract                 = {Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis of data and creation of business intelligence dashboards by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook's site features are also based on analyzing large data sets. These features range from simple reporting applications like Insights for the Facebook Advertisers, to more advanced kinds such as friend recommendations. In order to support this diversity of use cases on the ever increasing amount of data, a flexible infrastructure that scales up in a cost effective manner, is critical. We have leveraged, authored and contributed to a number of open source technologies in order to address these requirements at Facebook. These include Scribe, Hadoop and Hive which together form the cornerstones of the log collection, storage and analytics infrastructure at Facebook. In this paper we will present how these systems have come together and enabled us to implement a data warehouse that stores more than 15PB of data (2.5PB after compression) and loads more than 60TB of new data (10TB after compression) every day. We discuss the motivations behind our design choices, the capabilities of this solution, the challenges that we face in day today operations and future capabilities and improvements that we are working on.},

It focuses on individual appliances and begins by consideration of the electrical operations performed by the load. This approach allows for the loads to be categorised based on the electrical characteristics, and also provides information on the reactive power characteristics of the load, which is often neglected from standard consumption statistics. This data is particularly important for power system analysis. In addition to this, device ownership statistics and probability distribution functions of power demand are presented for the main residential loads. Although the data presented is primarily intended as a resource for the development of load profiles for power system analysis, it contains a large volume of information which provides a useful database for the wider research community.},

  abstract                 = {Rising energy costs in large data centers are driving an agenda for energy-efficient computing. In this paper, we focus on the role of database software in affecting, and, ultimately, improving the energy efficiency of a server. We first characterize the power-use profiles of database operators under different configuration parameters. We find that common database operations can exercise the full dynamic power range of a server, and that the CPU power consumption of different operators, for the same CPU utilization, can differ by as much as 60{\%}. We also find that for these operations CPU power does not vary linearly with CPU utilization. We then experiment with several classes of database systems and storage managers, varying parameters that span from different query plans to compression algorithms and from physical layout to CPU frequency and operating system scheduling. Contrary to what recent work has suggested, we find that within a single node intended for use in scale-out (shared-nothing) architectures, the most energy-efficient configuration is typically the highest performing one. We explain under which circumstances this is not the case, and argue that these circumstances do not warrant a retargeting of database system optimization goals. Further, our results reveal opportunities for cross-node energy optimizations and point out directions for new scale-out architectures.},

  abstract                 = {A new method is proposed for modelling state duration in hidden Markov model (HMM) speech recognition systems. State transition probabilities are expressed conditional on how long the current state has been occupied. The conventional fixed-state transition probabilities aij are replaced by duration-dependent variables aij(d) that depend on the time d already spent in state i. In this way, state transition and state duration probabilities are combined to form duration-dependent transition probabilities. The transition probabilities are derived from the cumulative density function (CDF) of state duration. The training of HMMs with duration-dependent transitions are based on maximum likelihood segmentation of training data, using the Viterbi algorithm. At each training iteration, the current HMM parameters are used to segment every training example. All the segments associated with each state are then used to update state observation and transition parameters. In experiments with a data set of spoken English alphabet, durational modelling improves the recognition accuracy by 5.6{\%}.},

Existing solutions for addressing the servers' energy consumption suggest "shrinking" the set of active machines, at least until the more power-proportional hardware devices become available. This paper demonstrates that leveraging the sleeping state, however, may lead to unacceptably poor performance and low data availability if the distributed services are not aware of the power management's actions. Therefore, we present an architecture for cluster services in which the deployed services overcome this problem by actively participating in any action taken by the power management. We propose, implement, and evaluate modifications for the Hadoop Distributed File System and the MapReduce clone that make them capable of operating efficiently under limited power budgets.},

  abstract                 = {Modelling power systems is an area of ongoing interest in the transmission management and control systems community. Continuing development is driven by two forces. The traditional tasks of model maintenance and management must be achieved with fewer resources. At the same time, model exchange and coordination has become a priority. The latter force arises from the disaggregation of utility functions and the introduction of power markets. This paper begins by identifying some of the power system modelling tasks that have become important, but are ill served by current tools and techniques. Among these are model versioning and version control, migration of models between, different schema, the transformation of models for different purposes or applications, and the merging of models from different sources. These tasks are typically handled by semi-manual methods or heavily customized software. The paper then describes the application of knowledge representation to power system modelling. In particular, the power of this approach to provide generic solutions to the, foregoing problems is explored. Knowledge representation is contrasted with more common data representations and put into context with current industry initiatives, EPRI CIM (common information model), UMS DAF (data access facility) and XML/CIM. Finally, the feasibility of using knowledge representation for power system models is illustrated with a case study from a major Australian distribution utility},

  abstract                 = {There is a need for flexible, inexpensive metering technologies that can be deployed in many different monitoring scenarios. Individual loads may be expected to compute information about their power consumption. Utility providers, facilities managers, and other consumers will likely find innumerable ways to mine information if made available in a useful form. However, appropriate sensing and information delivery systems remain a chief bottleneck for many applications, and metering hardware and access to metered information will likely limit the implementation of new electric energy conservation strategies in the near future. This thesis presents solutions for two long standing problems in nonintrusive power and diagnostic monitoring. First, a high-resolution, physically windowed sensor architecture that is well-suited for energy score-keeping and diagnostic applications will be discussed. The sensor can track a large-scale main signal while capturing small-scale variations. The prototype system uses digital techniques to reconstruct an observed current with a high effective bit resolution. The sensor measures a small current signal using a closed-loop Hall sensor. and extends the range by driving a compensation current with a high performance current source through an auxiliary winding. The system combines the compensation command and the sampled output of the residual sensor to reconstruct the input signal with high bit resolution and bandwidth. Second, a long-standing problem in nonintrusive power monitoring involves the tracking of power consumption in the in the presence of loads with a continuously variable power demand. Two new techniques have been developed for automatically disaggregating, in real-time. different classes of continuously variable power electronic loads which draw distorted line currents. Experimental results of the proposed power estimator extracting the power consumption of common variable power loads such as a variable speed drive, a computer, and a light dimmer are presented.},

Change-points often represent important events in the underlying processes, like a change in brain state reflected in EEG data or a change in the value of a company reflected in its stock price. However, change-points can be difficult to identify in noisy data streams. Previous attempts to identify change-points online using Bayesian inference relied on specifying in advance the rate at which they occur, called the hazard rate (h). This approach leads to predictions that can depend strongly on the choice of h and is unable to deal optimally with systems in which h is not constant in time. In this letter, we overcome these limitations by developing a hierarchical extension to earlier models. This approach allows h itself to be inferred from the data, which in turn helps to identify when change-points occur. We show that our approach can effectively identify change-points in both toy and real data sets with complex hazard rates and how it can be used as an ideal-observer model for human and animal behavior when faced with rapidly changing inputs.},

Methods that reward energy conservation in a number of ways have yielded meaningful short-run reductions. Extensions of current strategies and other procedures derived from a framework presented in the paper may eventually result in more pervasive, longer-term savings.

  abstract                 = {We propose a new framework for single-channel source separation that lies between the fully supervised and unsupervised setting. Instead of supervision, we provide input features for each source signal and use convex methods to estimate the correlations between these features and the unobserved signal decomposition. We analyze the case of {\$}\backslashell{\_}2{\$} loss theoretically and show that recovery of the signal components depends only on cross-correlation between features for different signals, not on correlations between features for the same signal. Contextually supervised source separation is a natural fit for domains with large amounts of data but no explicit supervision; our motivating application is energy disaggregation of hourly smart meter data (the separation of whole-home power signals into different energy uses). Here we apply contextual supervision to disaggregate the energy usage of thousands homes over four years, a significantly larger scale than previously published efforts, and demonstrate on synthetic data that our method outperforms the unsupervised approach.},

  abstract                 = {Many practically important problems involve processing very large data sets, such as for web scale data
mining and indexing. An efficient method to manage such problems is to use data intensive distributed
programming paradigms such as MapReduce and Dryad, that allow programmers to easily parallelize
the processing of large data sets where parallelism arises naturally by operating on different parts of
the data. Such data intensive computing infrastructures are now deployed at scales where the resource
costs, especially the energy costs of operating these infrastructures, have become a significant concern.
Many opportunities exist for optimizing the energy costs for data intensive computing and this paper
addresses one of them. We dynamically right size the resource allocations to the parallelized tasks such
that the effective hardware configuration matches the requirements of each task. This allows our system
to amortize the idle power usage of the servers across a larger amount of workload, increasing energy
efficiency as well as throughput. This paper describes why such dynamic resource allocation is useful
and presents the key techniques used in our solution.},

  abstract                 = {<p><br/>In wind energy conversion systems, one of the operational problems is the changeability and discontinuity of wind. In most cases, wind speed can fluctuate rapidly. Hence, quality of produced energy becomes an important problem in wind energy conversion plants. Several control techniques have been applied to improve the quality of power generated from wind turbines. Pitch control is the most efficient and popular power control method, especially for variable-speed wind turbines. It is a useful method for power regulation above the rated wind speed. This paper proposes an artificial neural network-based pitch angle controller for wind turbines. In the simulations, a variable-speed wind turbine is modeled, and its operation is observed by using two types of artificial neural network controllers. These are multi-layer perceptrons with back propagation learning algorithm and radial basis function network. It is shown that the power output was successfully regulated during high wind speed, and as a result overloading or outage of the wind turbine was prevented.</p>},

  abstract                 = {Due to the global warming and climate changes, using and conserving of the electrical energy effectively becomes a very important issue recently. If each appliance operates efficiently, the power energy can be used and conserved effectively. Further, the greenhouse gases can also gradually be reduced. This paper* proposes a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) system that employs a decision mechanism based on hierarchical support vector machines (HSVM) to identify the energizing and de-energizing statuses of each load. In the proposed system, the load energizing and de-energizing transient features are extracted from load current waveforms that are acquired at the power entering point. The HSVM performs load identification tasks based on the features. Although a support vector machine (SVM) identifier can solve nonlinear separable cases and optimize the decision hyper-plane, it is a two-class identifier. On the other hand, the NILM problem is a multi-class identification problem. Since any multi-class identification problem can be decomposed into a series of two-class identification sub-problems, the proposed system applies a group of binary SVMs that are arranged into a form of hierarchical tree to identify the operation status of each load. Each node within the tree represents a binary SVM identifier, and each identifier is assigned to solve a corresponding two-class sub-problem. Through this hierarchical decision process, the class of an undetermined datum can be identified. Finally, the results in different experiment environments show that the proposed system is able to identify the operation status of each load, and it also has appropriate robustness.},

This paper explores how to support energy as a first-class operating system resource. Energy, because of its global system nature, presents challenges beyond those of conventional resource management. To meet these challenges we propose the Currentcy Model that unifies energy accounting over diverse hardware components and enables fair allocation of available energy among applications. Our particular goal is to extend battery lifetime by limiting the average discharge rate and to share this limited resource among competing task according to user preferences. To demonstrate how our framework supports explicit control over the battery resource we implemented ECOSystem, a modified Linux, that incorporates our currentcy model. Experimental results show that ECOSystem accurately accounts for the energy consumed by asynchronous device operation, can achieve a target battery lifetime, and proportionally shares the limited energy resource among competing tasks.},

Fine-grained energy monitoring can be achieved by deploying smart power outlets on every device of interest; however it incurs extra hardware cost and installation complexity. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an attractive method for energy disaggregation, as it can discern devices from the aggregated data acquired from a single point of measurement. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of NILM system and its associated methods and techniques used for disaggregated energy sensing.

  abstract                 = {Brussels, 17th February 2012 â Citizens and business often waste energy because they do not realise which appliances and lighting use the most energy. An EU-funded project tested in the United Kingdom and Bulgaria is helping to change that â showing consumers reduced energy usage by an average of 8{\%} when provided with an "information dashboard" about their energy use.

The Digital Environment Home Energy Management System (DEHEMS) project shows that when a consumer receives more information about their energy use, and can share and compare this with neighbours and family, they are more likely to change their behaviour. The EU-funded system presents data every 6 seconds through a small digital display. The data can also be displayed in real time via a TV screen, mobile phone, PC or social media app.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes said: "People make better choices when they have better information at hand. The DEHEMS project shows that very simple technologies can go a long way to helping Europe reduce energy use."

The DEHEMS system could set a huge trend in the coming years. Two commercial products are now available: The "Energyhive" (www.energyhive.co.uk) and its network that enables members to get a real time view of their home energy consumption 24/7 through a web browser and "Greenica" (www.greenica.net) which offers special products for homes, schools and small businesses. Thanks to a partnership between Hildebrand and IBM, the DEHEMS project and its lessons will soon be used by businesses both in Europe and worldwide. Major deployment is foreseen with Smart Grids Australia (involving 50,000 homes) and a district heating initiative in Camden, London. Last but not least, the Family House Association in Birmingham is looking to use DEHEMS-type technology thanks to the results achieved so far.},

  abstract                 = {A computer programme which aims to cut power wastage in low-income households has been launched after a trial in five east London boroughs.

The Shimmer system assesses a home's electricity consumption and recommends ways to make it more efficient, the Energy Saving Trust said.

It also connects to an online accounting tool to encourage budgeting.

The project could "help a lot of people in future", said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice.

Last week an independent report found thousands of people die each year from illnesses linked to fuel poverty.

Shimmer works by connecting electrical appliances to "smart" plugs which measure the amount of power used and provide an itemised bill showing how much each item costs to run.

The programme then suggests how to cut costs, for instance by recommending more efficient boilers or fridges, and lists appropriate benefits and allowances available to the user.
'Smart homes'

A total of 18 homes, most of which were in debt and had little disposable income, tried the system in Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge and Waltham Forest.

The savings for each ran into hundreds of pounds a year, the trust said.

"Ultimately, we need to have smart homes, not just smart meters," said chief executive Philip Sellwood.

Citizens Advice said increasing numbers of people were seeking information on cutting fuel bills and saving energy.

"Around Â£18bn of means-tested benefits and tax credits is unclaimed this year and this project shows that some of the biggest 'savings' for households came as a result of advice on financial issues and benefit entitlements people either did not know about, or did not think were for them," said Ms Guy.

"Combining that advice with new technology which puts customers in control of their energy usage could be a powerful combination to help a lot of people in future."},

Based on the proposed disaggregation framework, we use three advanced disaggregation algorithms, called committee decision mechanisms (CDMs), to perform load disaggregation at the metering level. Three random switching simulators are also developed to investigate the performance of different CDMs under a variety of scenarios. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that all CDMs outperform any single-feature, single-algorithm-based disaggregation methods. With sensitivity analysis, we also show that the CDMs are less sensitive to any load dynamics and noise. We finally demonstrate some applications of this technology in terms of appliance usage tacking and estimated energy consumption of each appliance.},
