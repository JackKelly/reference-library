  Abstract                 = {Changepoints are abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed an algorithm to disaggregate short-interval (hourly) whole-building electrical load into major end uses. Hourly load data, hourly load-temperature regression coefficients and simulation end-use results comprise the algorithm input. The algorithm produces hourly load profiles for air conditioning, lighting, fans and pumps, and miscellaneous loads. Measured data from two end-use metered buildings (an office and a retail store) have been used to validate the algorithm. For the retail store, the algorithm estimates of hourly end use compare remarkably well with the monitored end-use data (average error of less than 5% during daytime operation). For the office building, the algorithm gives a consistent bias of about 12 and 27% in overestimating the HVAC and lighting electric loads, respectively, at the expense of underestimating the miscellaenous load by 35%. Results may be attributed to the presence of inconsistencies between office audit information and measured end-use data. A three-fold difference between the auditor's estimate for miscellaneous energy use and the metered amount has been found. The validation, however, indicates great promise for application of the algorithm to whole-building load data for obtaining reliable end-use data.},

In particular, we introduce metrics that incorporate information contained in the power signal instead of strict detection rates. We show that this information is important for NILM applications with the goal of improving appliance energy disaggregation.

Motivated by this, we --- a transnational collaboration of researchers engaged in development and deployment of technologies for sustainable buildings --- have developed SensorAct, an open-source federated middleware incorporating features targeting three specific requirements: (i) Accommodating a richer ecosystem of sensors, actuators, and higher level third-party applications (ii) Participatory engagement of stakeholders other than the facilities department, such as occupants, in setting policies for management of sensor data and control of electrical systems, without compromising on the overall privacy and safety, and (iii) Flexible interfacing and information exchange with systems external to a building, such as communication networks, transportation system, electrical grid, and other buildings, for better management, by exploiting the teleconnections that exist across them. SensorAct is designed to scale from small homes to network of buildings, making it suitable not only for production use but to also seed a global-scale network of building testbeds with appropriately constrained and policed access. This paper describes SensorAct's architecture, current implementation, and preliminary performance results.},

Second, billions of dollars are being spent to install smart meters, yet the energy saving and financial benefits of this infrastructure – without careful consideration of the human element – will not reach its full potential. We believe that we can address these problems by strategically marrying them, using disaggregation. Disaggregation refers to a set of statistical approaches for extracting end-use and/or appliance level data from an aggregate, or whole-building, energy signal. In this paper, we explain how appliance level data affords numerous benefits, and why using the algorithms in conjunction with smart meters is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for getting this data. We review disaggregation algorithms and their requirements, and evaluate the extent to which smart meters can meet those requirements. Research, technology, and policy recommendations are also outlined.},

The approach is based on the embedding of multivariate time series data associated with normal process conditions, followed by the extraction of features from the resulting lagged trajectory matrix. The features are extracted by recasting the data into a binary classification problem, which can be solved with a random forest model. A proximity matrix can be calculated from the model and from this matrix features can be extracted that represent the trajectory of the system in phase space. The results of the study suggest that the random forest approach may afford distinct advantages over a previously proposed linear equivalent, particularly when complex nonlinear systems need to be monitored.},

  Abstract                 = {Smart meter deployments are spurring renewed interest in analysis techniques for electricity usage data. An important prerequisite for data analysis is characterizing and modeling how electrical loads use power. While prior work has made significant progress in deriving insights from electricity data, one issue that limits accuracy is the use of general and often simplistic load models. Prior models often associate a fixed power level with an “on” state and either no power, or some minimal amount, with an “off” state. This paper’s goal is to develop a new methodology for modeling electric loads that is both simple and accurate. Our approach is empirical in nature: we monitor a wide variety of common loads to distill a small number of common usage characteristics, which we leverage to construct accurate load-specific models. We show that our models are significantly more accurate than binary on-off models, decreasing the root mean square error by as much as 8X for representative loads. Finally, we demonstrate two example uses of our models in data analysis: i) generating device-accurate synthetic traces of building electricity usage, and ii) filtering out loads that generate rapid and random power variations in building electricity data},

Our data captures many important aspects of the home environment, including average household electricity usage every second, as well as usage at every circuit and nearly every plug load, electricity generation data from on-site solar panels and wind turbines, outdoor weather data, temperature and humidity data in indoor rooms, and, finally, data for a range of important binary events, e.g., at wall switches, the HVAC system, doors, and from motion sensors. We also have electricity usage data every minute from 400 anonymous homes. This data corpus has served as the foundation for much of our recent research.

  Abstract                 = {Buildings are one of the largest consumers of electricity. Dominant electricity consumption within the buildings, contributed by plug loads, lighting and air conditioning, can be significantly improved using Occupancy-based Building Management Systems (Ob-BMS). In this paper, we address three critical aspects of Ob-BMS i.e. 1) Modular sensor node design to support diverse deployment scenarios; 2) Building architecture to support and scale fine resolution monitoring; and 3) Detailed analysis of the collected data for smarter actuation. We present key learning across these three aspects evolved over more than one year of design and deployment experiences. The sensor node design evolved over a period of time to address specific deployment requirements. With an opportunity at the host institute where two dorm buildings were getting constructed, we planned for the support infrastructure required for fine resolution monitoring embedded in the design phase and share our preliminary experiences and key learning thereof. Prototype deployment of the sensing system as per the planned support infrastructure was performed at two faculty offices with effective data collection worth 45 days. Collected data is analyzed accounting for efficient switching of appliances, in addition to energy conservation and user comfort as performed in the earlier occupancy based frameworks. Our analysis shows that occupancy prediction using simple heuristic based modeling can achieve similar performance as more complex Hidden Markov Models, thus simplifying the analytic framework.},

While smart monitoring and control of appliances can reduce the overall energy consumption, management and cost associated with such systems act as a big hindrance. Prior work has established that detailed feedback in the form of appliance level consumption to building occupants improves their awareness and paves the way for reduction in electricity consumption. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), i.e. the process of disaggregating the overall home electricity usage measured at the meter level into constituent appliances, provides a simple and cost effective methodology to provide such feedback to the occupants. In this paper we present Improved Non-Intrusive load monitoring using load Division and Calibration (INDiC) that simplifies NILM by dividing the appliances across multiple instrumented points (meters/phases) and calibrating the measured power. Proposed approach is used together with the Combinatorial Optimization framework and evaluated on the popular REDD dataset. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvement in disaggregation accuracy, achieved by using INDiC based Combinatorial Optimization, demonstrate significant improvement in disaggregation accuracy.},

More than three decades of work in NILM has resulted in the development of several novel algorithmic approaches. However, despite these advancements, two core challenges still exist: i) disaggregating low power consumption appliances and ii) distinguishing between multiple instances of similar appliances. These challenges are becoming increasingly important due to an increasing number of appliances and increased usage of electronics in homes. Previous approaches have attempted to solve these problems using expensive hardware involving high sampling rates better suited to laboratory settings, or using additional number of sensors, limiting the ease of deployment. In this work, we explore using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) power line communication (PLC) modems as an inexpensive and easy to deploy alternative solution to these problems. We use the reduction in bandwidth between two PLC modems, caused due to the change in PLC modulation scheme when different appliances are operated as a signature for an appliance. Since the noise generated in the powerline is dependent both on type and location of an appliance, we believe that our technique based on PLC modems can be a promising addition for solving NILM.},

Building upon more than a year of experience in sensor network deployments, we undertake an extensive deployment in a three storey home in Delhi, spanning 73 days from May-August 2013, measuring electrical, water and ambient parameters. We used 33 sensors across the home, measuring these parameters, collecting a total of approx. 400 MB of data daily. We discuss the architectural implications on the deployment systems that can be used for monitoring and control in the context of developing countries. Addressing the unreliability of electrical grid and internet in such settings, we present Sense Local-store Upload architecture for robust data collection. While providing several unique aspects, our deployment further validates the common considerations from similar residential deployments, discussed previously in the literature.

However, empirically comparing disaggregation algorithms is currently virtually impossible. This is due to the different data sets used, the lack of reference implementations of these algorithms and the variety of accuracy metrics employed. To address this challenge, we present the Non-intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit (NILMTK); an open source toolkit designed specifically to enable the comparison of energy disaggregation algorithms in a reproducible manner. This work is the first research to compare multiple disaggregation approaches across multiple publicly available data sets. Our toolkit includes parsers for a range of existing data sets, a collection of preprocessing algorithms, a set of statistics for describing data sets, two reference benchmark disaggregation algorithms and a suite of accuracy metrics. We demonstrate the range of reproducible analyses which are made possible by our toolkit, including the analysis of six publicly available data sets and the evaluation of both benchmark disaggregation algorithms across such data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},

For each article, we analyze the purpose of the study, the content to be taught with the aid of robotics, the type of robot used, the research method used, and the sample characteristics (sample size, age range of students and/or level of education) and the results observed. The articles reviewed suggest that educational robotics usually acts as an element that enhances learning, however, this is not always the case, as there are studies that have reported situations in which there was no improvement in learning. The outcomes of the literature review are discussed in terms of their implications for future research, and can provide useful guidance for educators, practitioners and researchers in the area.},

While hardware-based sub-metering is costly and labor-intensive, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is capable of gathering detailed energy-use data with minimal equipment cost and installation time. However, variations in measurements between metering devices complicate the process of compiling the necessary appliance profiles.

We installed a NILM prototype system in an apartment building, and a plug-level power meter was used to accurately track the individual consumption of this appliance.

  Abstract                 = {The need to achieve a transition to a low carbon economy has renewed interest in "energy efficiency" and what has become known as "demand side management". This thesis investigates the role of measurement and modelling in the management of domestic electricity demand. Practice and policy have, since the 1950s, tended to favour a "supply paradigm" centred on the imperative of increasing energy supply. Despite the upheaval of market liberalisation, and twenty years of climate change debate, the domestic electricity "culture" has changed very little. The first half of this thesis contributes to this subject by describing the complex development of the electricity system that we are familiar with today. Drawing upon technical, social and political themes, the current and emerging practices of measurement, modelling, and management are critiqued. It is argued that current practices require revaluation, if alternative, decentralised approaches are to receive a fair analysis. The thesis contributes in empirical terms by extending the evidence base and developing modelling tools for the analysis of domestic electricity use. Field data collected by the author concerning the power flow characteristics of domestic appliances are presented which identify the dynamic nature of domestic electrical loads. A modelling framework is then introduced that combines social and technical aspects of domestic energy demand, allowing synthesis of domestic load profiles and allowing comparison between localised interventions.},

  Abstract                 = {The residential sector uses nearly 30% of all electricity in Canada, and, it is important to know how this energy is being used, so that savings may be identified and realised. We propose a method that can be applied to hourly whole-house electrical energy data to partially disaggregate total household electricity use into five load categories/parameters (base load, activity load, heating season gradient, cooling season gradient and lowest external temperature at which air-conditioning is used). This paper develops the proposed method, and verifies it using high-resolution end-use data from twelve households with known characteristics. We then apply the method to hourly whole-house (smart meter) data from 327 households in Ontario. The roll-out of smart (advanced) metering infrastructure in many countries will make hourly whole-house data abundant, and we propose that this method could be widely applied by utilities to target their demand-side management programs towards households more likely to provide benefits, thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of such programs.},

the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness
and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining
powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development.
Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements
over intermediate representations.},

Two problems are examined. In the first problem the data is given in the traditional form of a string so the novel aspect is that insertions and deletions are now corrected. In the second problem, a unique string need not be given, but a regular language is given, and any string belonging to the regular language is a possible data string. Again, deletion addition, and changes of symbols are corrected. A direct generalization of the Viterbi decoding algorithm is thus proved to be an efficient technique for solving a much wider class of problems},

Energy efficiency measures can contribute to local, national and EU policy commitments on carbon reduction. Yet, research also shows behaviour change is anything but simple. No-where is this more evident that in local government where municipalities are expected to lead on carbon reduction initiatives whilst operating in challenging political landscapes. This paper reflects on a UK Research Council funded case study exploring the role of engagement in a UK municipality. Innovative feedback tools and user-engagement were developed in an effort to foster a collaborative approach to energy management.

Findings from an analysis of a focus group and a set of semi-structured interviews show encouraging signs with regard to increased user-engagement and digital tools, but barriers remain with regards to the ‘real world’ implementation of innovative, and technologically grounded, approaches. These included a staff reduction programme amidst financial cuts, a risk-averse culture with regard to new technologies, and debate about where responsibilities lie with regards to energy management. While these findings were case specific they have implications for organisations contemplating how technology might support them in workplace engagement for reduced energy use.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks frorn data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented.

The main original contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms.},

Most carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the burning of fossil fuels will eventually be absorbed by the ocean1, with potentially adverse consequences for marine biota2, 3, 4. Here we quantify the changes in ocean pH that may result from this continued release of CO2 and compare these with pH changes estimated from geological and historical records. We find that oceanic absorption of CO2 from fossil fuels may result in larger pH changes over the next several centuries than any inferred from the geological record of the past 300 million years, with the possible exception of those resulting from rare, extreme events such as bolide impacts or catastrophic methane hydrate degassing.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Residential electricity users need more detail than monthly bills to reduce consumption. With the emergence of technologies that provide detailed usage estimates for energy consumption, two questions arise. First, how many different energy-consuming appliances contribute to household electricity load, and secondly which appliances? Using national average penetration rates, the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), estimates that 42 unique appliances account for 93% of electricity consumption, while 12 appliances account for 80% of average household electric load. A typical scenario is developed from national and regional penetration rates and find that eight appliances are responsible for 80% of a household's electric load in the United States. Four household scenarios are developed: a house that uses electric appliances, gas appliances, the average household, and typical household. It is concluded that RECS cannot be used as a representative household as it overestimates the number of appliances that contribute to a household electric load. The number of significant appliances is affected by appliance ownership and use, which is more variable between homes than between census divisions. These results can be used to design and maximize the value of residential energy information and management systems.},

disaggregated information has two major impacts: increased consumer engagement and reduced
energy usage. This paper highlights results from two case studies conducted in real life – one in
California and other international. The study in California, using an experimental design, shows a
statistical proof of average 14% energy reduction in users exposed to Bidgely’s Energy
Disaggregation-based solution with a maximum of 24% and a minimum of 3.5%. The international
study shows high levels of consumer engagement, favorable consumer reaction and an 80% approval
from users on making this solution available to all. These studies aim to support the introduction of
policies that open up real time data access from Smart Meters. Millions of these Smart Meters installed
in field are already equipped with the right hardware but have not been enabled to deliver the above
benefits.},

Our SELF implementation runs twice as fast as the fastest Smalltalk implementation, despite SELF's lack of classes and explicit variables. To compensate for the absence of classes, our system uses implementation-level maps to transparently group objects cloned from the same prototype, providing data type information and eliminating the apparent space overhead for prototype-based systems. To compensate for dynamic typing, user-defined control structures, and the lack of explicit variables, our system dynamically compiles multiple versions of a source method, each customized according to its receiver's map. Within each version the type of the receiver is fixed, and thus the compiler can statically bind and inline all messages sent to self. Message splitting and type prediction extract and preserve even more static type information, allowing the compiler to inline many other messages. Inlining dramatically improves performance and eliminates the need to hard-wire low-level methods such as +,==, and ifTrue:. Despite inlining and other optimizations, our system still supports interactive programming environments. The system traverses internal dependency lists to invalidate all compiled methods affected by a programming change. The debugger reconstructs inlined stack frames from compiler-generated debugging information, making inlining invisible to the SELF programmer.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. The proposed RNN, gated-feedback RNN (GF-RNN), extends the existing approach of stacking multiple recurrent layers by allowing and controlling signals flowing from upper recurrent layers to lower layers using a global gating unit for each pair of layers. The recurrent signals exchanged between layers are gated adaptively based on the previous hidden states and the current input. We evaluated the proposed GF-RNN with different types of recurrent units, such as tanh, long short-term memory and gated recurrent units, on the tasks of character-level language modeling and Python program evaluation. Our empirical evaluation of different RNN units, revealed that in both tasks, the GF-RNN outperforms the conventional approaches to build deep stacked RNNs. We suggest that the improvement arises because the GF-RNN can adaptively assign different layers to different timescales and layer-to-layer interactions (including the top-down ones which are not usually present in a stacked RNN) by learning to gate these interactions.},

Here, we extend the reconstruction of global mean sea level back to 1870 and find a sea-level rise from January 1870 to December 2004 of 195 mm, a 20th century rate of sea-level rise of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm yr−1 and a significant acceleration of sea-level rise of 0.013 ± 0.006 mm yr−2. This acceleration is an important confirmation of climate change simulations which show an acceleration not previously observed. If this acceleration remained constant then the 1990 to 2100 rise would range from 280 to 340 mm, consistent with projections in the IPCC TAR.},

  Abstract                 = {The brain has an extraordinary capacity for memory storage, but how it stores new information without disrupting previously acquired memories remains unknown. Here we show that different motor learning tasks induce dendritic Ca2+ spikes on different apical tuft branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex. These task-related, branch-specific Ca2+ spikes cause long-lasting potentiation of postsynaptic dendritic spines active at the time of spike generation. When somatostatin-expressing interneurons are inactivated, different motor tasks frequently induce Ca2+ spikes on the same branches. On those branches, spines potentiated during one task are depotentiated when they are active seconds before Ca2+ spikes induced by another task. Concomitantly, increased neuronal activity and performance improvement after learning one task are disrupted when another task is learned. These findings indicate that dendritic-branch-specific generation of Ca2+ spikes is crucial for establishing long-lasting synaptic plasticity, thereby facilitating information storage associated with different learning experiences.},

Here we present a detailed stable-isotope record for the full length of the Greenland Ice-core Project Summit ice core, extending over the past 250 kyr according to a calculated timescale. We find that climate instability was not confined to the last glaciation, but appears also to have been marked during the last interglacial (as explored more fully in a companion paper) and during the previous Saale–Holstein glacial cycle. This is in contrast with the extreme stability of the Holocene, suggesting that recent climate stability may be the exception rather than the rule. The last interglacial seems to have lasted longer than is implied by the deep-sea SPECMAP record, in agreement with other land-based observations. We suggest that climate instability in the early part of the last interglacial may have delayed the melting of the Saalean ice sheets in America and Eurasia, perhaps accounting for this discrepancy},

  Abstract                 = {Most domestic energy use, most of the time, is invisible to the user. Most people
have only a vague idea of how much energy they are using for different purposes
and what sort of difference they could make by changing day-to-day behaviour or
investing in efficiency measures. Hence the importance of feedback in making
energy more visible and more amenable to understanding and control. This
review considers what is known about the effectiveness of feedback to
householders. The focus is on how people change their behaviour, not on the
detail of the technology used.
There is considerable variety in the feedback literature, but common themes
emerge. The first studies, in the 1970s, established that feedback (mostly via
display monitors) has measurable effects and was worth pursuing, on its own or
in combination with other processes. Feedback came to be seen in terms of a
learning tool, allowing energy users to teach themselves through
experimentation. Overall, the literature demonstrates that clear feedback is a
necessary element in learning how to control fuel use more effectively over a long
period of time and that instantaneous direct feedback in combination with
frequent, accurate billing (a form of indirect feedback) is needed as a basis for
sustained demand reduction. Thus feedback is useful on its own, as a self-
teaching tool. It is also clear that it improves the effectiveness of other
information and advice in achieving better understanding and control of energy
use.},

  Abstract                 = {This quarterly release presents statistics on the roll-out of smart meters in Great
Britain. It includes information on the number of smart meters that have been
installed in domestic properties and smaller non-domestic sites in the last quarter
and the total number of meters in operation as of 30 June 2015 by the nine larger
energy suppliers.

The Smart Metering Programme is currently in Foundation Stage, which began in
March 2011. The Government is working with the energy industry, consumer groups
and other stakeholders to put commercial and regulatory frameworks in place to
support smart metering, trial and test systems, learn lessons from early installations
and enhance the consumer experience. Most householders will then have smart
meters installed by their energy company in the period between 2016 and 2020.
Further information can be found on the GOV.UK website.

Energy suppliers are currently installing and operating smart meters, smart-type
meters and traditional meters in domestic properties and smart meters, advanced
meters and traditional meters in smaller non-domestic sites (an explanation of
differences between meter types can be found in Section 1.2 of the Introduction).

Key Points

* 272,600 smart meters (160,500 electricity meters and 112,100 gas meters)
were installed in domestic properties in quarter two 2015 (Figure 1 and Table 1),
a 29 per cent increase on the number of meters installed during quarter one
2015. An estimated total of 1,327,400 domestic smart meters have been installed
up to 30 June 2015 by the larger energy suppliers.

* 1,193,200 smart meters are now operating in ‘smart mode’ in domestic
properties across Great Britain (Table 2). This represents an increase of 249,700
since the end of quarter one 2015 and 2.5 per cent of all domestic meters
operated by the larger energy suppliers (Figure 2).

* 2,300 smart meters (which includes 100 gas meters) and 16,400 advanced
meters (12,100 electricity meters and 4,300 gas meters) were installed in smaller
non-domestic sites in quarter two 2015 (Figure 3 and Table 3). An estimated total
of 621,400 smart and advanced meters have been installed to 30 June 2015 in
smaller non-domestic sites by the larger energy suppliers.

* 538,400 smart and advanced meters are now operating in smaller nondomestic
sites across Great Britain (Table 4). This represents 19.8 per cent of all
smaller non-domestic site meters operated by the larger energy suppliers
(Figure 4).},

  Abstract                 = {Energy disaggregation, also known as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), is the task of separating aggregate energy data for a whole building into the energy data for individual appliances. Studies have shown that simply providing disaggregated data to the consumer improves energy consumption behavior. However, placing individual sensors on every device in a home is not presently a practical solution. Disaggregation provides a feasible method for providing energy usage behavior data to the consumer which utilizes currently existing infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel framework to perform the energy disaggregation task. We model each individual device as a single-input, single-output system, where the output is the power consumed by the device and the input is the device usage. In this framework, the task of disaggregation translates into finding inputs for each device that generates our observed power consumption. We describe an implementation of this framework, and show its results on simulated data as well as data from a small-scale experiment.},

The winning model on the localization sub-task was a network that predicts a single bounding box and a confidence score for each object category in the image. Such a model captures the whole-image context around the objects but cannot handle multiple instances of the same object in the image without naively replicating the number of outputs for each instance. In this work, we propose a saliency-inspired neural network model for detection, which predicts a set of class-agnostic bounding boxes along with a single score for each box, corresponding to its likelihood of containing any object of interest. The model naturally handles a variable number of instances for each class and allows for cross-class generalization at the highest levels of the network. We are able to obtain competitive recognition performance on VOC2007 and ILSVRC2012, while using only the top few predicted locations in each image and a small number of neural network evaluations.},

  Abstract                 = {The implementation of Smart Grids is central to the development of the European Internal Market
for Energy. The drive for lower-carbon generation, combined with greatly improved efficiency on
the demand side, will empower consumers to select their most innovative suppliers capable to offer
outstanding programs for energy efficiency.
Member States shall ensure the implementation of Smart Grids, not only to meet the Carbon
emissions and renewable targets, but also to meet the energy efficiency target in which customers
will participate actively reversing the overall production to supply value chain.
To meet the objectives of aligning regulatory requirements with Smart Grids projects
implementation by 2020 without barriers, a Smart Grids Task Force has been established in
November 2009 to advise the Commission on policy and regulatory directions at European level
and to coordinate the first steps towards the implementation of Smart Grids under the provision of
the Third Energy Package.
DIGITALEUROPE is one of 25 European Associations representing all European Stakeholders
that are assumed to play a role in the implementation of Smart Grids.
DIGITALEUROPE has decided to participate actively in the Smart Grids Task Force through the
participation in the 3 working groups that have been setup, the Steering Committee and the issue
of the present position paper representing the position of DIGITALEUROPE members.
We believe that Grids cannot become Smart Grids without the paradigm shift to the new era of
Energy Information Management. We believe that other manufacturing and Services sectors have
been able to modernize themselves and become more consumers oriented when they became
digitalized. DIGITALEUROPE believes in the equation of Smart is Digital and Digital is measuring, predicting and monitoring in real time the Energy we want to save and use as a precious resource, not anymore a commodity.},

The results prove that the whole-house electricity consumption can be disaggregated into its major end-uses, using a pattern recognition approach and only one sensor installed on the main electric entrance of the house. It also required a one-time submetering of the target appliances during the training period, of about a week, to find the electric characteristics of appliances. The results are provided in terms of daily load profiles, energy consumption and energy contribution of selected appliances. The proposed method was tested with monitored data from 3 weeks: (i) the training period of 1 week in October, (ii) the near-to-date testing period of 1 week in November and (iii) the far-to-date testing period of 1 week in January. For instance, the difference between monitored and estimated contribution is, for the month of October 1996, as follows: (i) 13 kW h or $0.85 for the DHW heater and (ii) 6 kW h or $0.36 for the refrigerator. The overall difference for both appliances does not exceed $1.25 for the month of October, for a total electricity bill of 912 kW h and $60.60, which appears to be acceptable for every homeowner. The errors in evaluating the daily energy consumption is between −10.5% and 15.9% for both the DWH heater and the refrigerator.},

This approach is based on the use of recursions, and is related to work on product partition models. The computational complexity of the approach is quadratic in the number of observations, but an approximate version, which introduces negligible error, and whose computational cost is roughly linear in the number of observations, is also possible. Our approach can be useful, for example within an MCMC algorithm, even when the independence assumptions do not hold. We demonstrate our approach on coal-mining disaster data and on well-log data. Our method can cope with a range of models, and exact simulation from the posterior distribution is possible in a matter of minutes.},

The most well-known examples are energy monitoring, health care applications, in-home activity modeling, and home automation. Real-time energy-use analysis for whole-home approaches needs to understand where and when the electrical loads are spent. Studies have shown that individual loads can be detected (and disaggregated) from sampling the power at one single point (e.g. the electric service entrance for the house) using a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) approach. In this paper, we focus on the feature extraction and pattern recognition tasks for non-intrusive residential electrical consumption traces. In particular, we develop an algorithm capable of determining the step-changes in signals that occur whenever a device is turned on or off, and which allows for the definition of a unique signature (ID) for each device. This algorithm makes use of features extracted from active and reactive powers and power factor. The classification task is carried out by Support Vector Machines and 5-Nearest Neighbors methods. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed signature for distinguishing the different loads.},

  Abstract                 = {Improving energy efficiency by monitoring household electrical consumption is of significant importance with the present-day climate change concerns. A solution for the electrical consumption management problem is the use of a non-intrusive load monitoring system (NILM). This system captures the signals from the aggregate consumption, extracts the features from these signals and classifies the extracted features in order to identify the switched on appliances. An effective device identification (ID) requires a signature to be assigned for each appliance. Moreover, to specify an ID for each device, signal processing techniques are needed for extracting the relevant features. This paper describes a technique for the steady-states recognition in an electrical digital signal as the first stage for the implementation of an innovative NILM. Furthermore, the final goal is to develop an intelligent system for the identification of the appliances by automated learning. The proposed approach is based on the ratio value between rectangular areas defined by the signal samples. The computational experiments show the method effectiveness for the accurate steady-states identification in the electrical input signals.},

  Abstract                 = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a simple and effective framework for modelling time-varying spectral vector sequences. As a consequence, almost all present day large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems are based on HMMs. Whereas the basic principles underlying HMM-based LVCSR are rather straightforward, the approximations and simplifying assumptions involved in a direct implementation of these principles would result in a system which has poor accuracy and unacceptable sensitivity to changes in operating environment. Thus, the practical application of HMMs in modern systems involves considerable sophistication. The aim of this review is first to present the core architecture of a HMM-based LVCSR system and then describe the various refinements which are needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These refinements include feature projection, improved covariance modelling, discriminative parameter estimation, adaptation and normalisation, noise compensation and multi-pass system combination. The review concludes with a case study of LVCSR for Broadcast News and Conversation transcription in order to illustrate the techniques described.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines the recent development of unconventional gas sources and specifically how
they will affect gas markets in China, India, and Australia.
Main Argument
Unconventional gas—comprised of coal bed methane (CBM), tight gas, and shale gas—will
likely play a more important role in nations’ supplies by 2020. China, India, and Australia are the
most likely nations in the Asia-Pacific to follow the United States’ example of changing liquefied
natural gas (LNG) supplies by exploiting unconventional reserves. China, already a large
producer of tight gas, will likely not see greater production in shale and CBM for several more
years. India also has potential for CBM extraction due to plentiful coal reserves, but coal blocks
allocated for CBM development a decade ago have not produced tangible supplies. Australia, however, has planned projects in all three categories of unconventional gas, which accounts for
45% of Australia’s announced LNG export capacity. Though technical, logistic, economic, environmental, and commercial challenges will likely prevent all planned Australian projects
from being completed by 2020, the potential for greater Australian LNG exports through
unconventional gas is evident.
Policy Implications
Though extraction efforts are in their nascent stage, India and China could become more
self-sufficient in the natural gas market if they pursued unconventional gas sources in as
aggressive a manner as Australia.
U.S. technological advances in shale gas extraction could serve as a model for increased
shale gas extraction in Asian nations.
While Australia is a leading producer and exporter of unconventional gas and stands to
greatly increase its exports over the next decade, the country is unlikely to maximize its
potential unless high cost and logistical complexities for planned ventures are remedied.
There is great potential for LNG oversupply in Asia, which could result in lower prices to
stimulate greater demand, delays in the start of projects, lower utilization rates in supply
projects, or the export of LNG outside traditional consumption centers.},

The system is based on a combination of the deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network architecture and the Connectionist Temporal Classification objective function. A modification to the objective function is introduced that trains the network to minimise the expectation of an arbitrary transcription loss function. This allows a direct optimisation of the word error rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or language model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3% on the Wall Street Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9% with only a lexicon of allowed words, and 8.2% with a trigram language model. Combining the network with a baseline system further reduces the error rate to 6.7%.},

However, the results in that work relied on recurrent-neural-network-specific objective functions, which are difficult to integrate with existing large vocabulary speech recognition systems. This paper investigates the use of DBLSTM as an acoustic model in a standard neural network-HMM hybrid system. We find that a DBLSTM-HMM hybrid gives equally good results on TIMIT as the previous work. It also outperforms both GMM and deep network benchmarks on a subset of the Wall Street Journal corpus. However the improvement in word error rate over the deep network is modest, despite a great increase in framelevel accuracy. We conclude that the hybrid approach with DBLSTM appears to be well suited for tasks where acoustic modelling predominates. Further investigation needs to be conducted to understand how to better leverage the improvements in frame-level accuracy towards better word error rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Recognizing lines of unconstrained handwritten text is a challenging task. The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7 percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance.},

Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this pa- per we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hi- erarchical processing on difficult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modelling when trained with sim- ple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales.},

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

We review events exhibiting evidence for elevated atmospheric CO2, global warming, and ocean acidification over the past ~300 million years of Earth’s history, some with contemporaneous extinction or evolutionary turnover among marine calcifiers. Although similarities exist, no past event perfectly parallels future projections in terms of disrupting the balance of ocean carbonate chemistry—a consequence of the unprecedented rapidity of CO2 release currently taking place.},

  Abstract                 = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.},

  Abstract                 = {Aggregate INDC emissions are far above levels consistent with below
2°C, with around 65% of global emissions covered
INDCs announced by 1 September 2015 lead to global emissions far above the levels
needed by 2025 and 2030 to put the world on track to hold warming below 2°C, or to below
1.5°C, in 2100.
As of 1st September, 29 INDC submissions have been received, reflecting 56 countries
(including the European Union member states), and covering around 65% of global
emissions in 2010 (excluding LULUCF) and 43% of global population. The CAT has directly
assessed 16 of these INDCs covering 64.5% of global emissions in 2010 (excluding LULUCF)
and 41% of global population.
With the INDCs submitted to date, the CAT projects total global emissions are on track to
be 53-57 GtCO2e in 2025 and 55-59 GtCO2e in 2030, far above the least-cost global
pathways consistent with limiting warming below 2°C. Additional reductions in the order of
12-15 GtO2e by 2025 and of 17-21 GtCO2e by 2030 are needed for global emissions to be
consistent with a 2°C pathway.
INDCs are yet to come from 140 countries. The ten highest emitters yet to submit INDCs
are India, Brazil, Iran, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and
Pakistan, together accounting for 18% of global emissions not yet covered by INDCs
(excluding LULUCF).
Aside from the insufficient ambition of the aggregate INDCs, there is a significant gap
between current policies and the INDCs: global emissions under currently implemented
policies are projected to be higher than the already inadequate INDC levels. Some countries
propose INDCs close to the current trajectory giving confidence that they are met (e.g. EU
and China). Others have put forward a target that would be a significant change in trend, but these are not yet supported by any significant existing legislation, e.g. Australia and
Canada, raising questions about the likely implementation. Yet others are showing progress
in policy implementation, continuously moving their future trajectories downwards, but
policies are not yet sufficient to meet their (still inadequate) INDCs (e.g. USA).
The gap between pledges and policies increases through time, highlighting the need for
long-term policy action. This is not to underplay the significance and importance of
governments putting in place policies that will actually reduce their emissions, but for many
governments this is not yet the case.},

In contrast with the majority of the existing approaches to solve this problem which require training, here we explore an unsupervised approach to determine the number of appliances in the household, their power consumption and state, at any given moment. We attempt to achieve this without using any a priori information on the number and type of appliances. Our approach is to first create clusters of steady-state changes and then employ a matching pursuit algorithm to reconstruct the original power signals using the clusters that were found as the sources in a linear blind source separation strategy. Changes in steady-state, sometimes referred to as events, are characterized by their change in real and reactive power (P and Q). Ultimately, the results may be applied to other features in an attempt to improve the separation between clusters. The preliminary results point toward a mixed scenario: large appliances (roughly above 400W) were easily identified, but the small appliances typically clustered together and were difficult to separate. We conclude that the errors occur during clustering which indicates that, in order to increase the purity of the clusters, perhaps other features could be used.},

Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

Our pipeline effectively unifies joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch. Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* - "blue" + "red" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800 images are made available for comparison.},

problems that can be tackled using approaches from data

aimed at furthering research on energy disaggregation (the
task of determining the component appliance contributions
from an aggregated electricity signal). We discuss past approaches
to disaggregation and how they have influenced our
design choices in collecting data, we describe the hardware

initial benchmark disaggregation results using a well-known
Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) technique.},

  Abstract                 = {Sequence prediction and classification are ubiquitous and challenging problems in machine learning that can require identifying complex dependencies between temporally distant inputs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have the ability, in theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the short-term memory implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections. However, in practice they are difficult to train successfully when the long-term memory is required. This paper introduces a simple, yet powerful modification to the standard RNN architecture, the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations only at its prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more complex, CW-RNN reduces the number of RNN parameters, improves the performance significantly in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The network is demonstrated in preliminary experiments involving two tasks: audio signal generation and TIMIT spoken word classification, where it outperforms both RNN and LSTM networks.},

Neuroevolution (NE), used for continuous RL problems, has to either reduce the problem dimensionality by (1) compressing the representation of the neural network controllers or (2) employing a pre-processor (compressor) that transforms the high-dimensional raw inputs into low-dimensional features. In this paper, we are able to evolve extremely small recurrent neural network (RNN) controllers for a task that previously required networks with over a million weights. The high-dimensional visual input, which the controller would normally receive, is first transformed into a compact feature vector through a deep, max-pooling convolutional neural network (MPCNN). Both the MPCNN preprocessor and the RNN controller are evolved successfully to control a car in the TORCS racing simulator using only visual input. This is the first use of deep learning in the context evolutionary RL.},

In order to monitoring the status of each load, a sensor is installed for each load traditionally. The status of the load is transmitted to the main controller such that the status of each load can be monitored. On the other hand, the NILM is able to detect the status of loads by analyzing the current signals that is picked-up by a current sensor installed at the main electrical panel. Traditional NILM methods used real power, reactive power, harmonic contents of power signatures and transient energy to determine the status of appliances. These methods are very complex and require a lot of computation. In this paper, a novel method that integrates artificial intelligent recognition technique and load current acquisition method for NILM is proposed. The proposed method uses timedomain information. This approach is different from traditional NILM methods. The proposed method is able to detect the energization and de-energization of loads by applying back-propagation neural networks (BP-ANNs). The overall correct rate for this method is above 98.75%. This result shows that the proposed method is able to determine the operation status of loads with proper robustness.},

These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

  Abstract                 = {Recent work on deep neural networks as acoustic mod-
els for automatic speech recognition (ASR) have demon-
strated substantial performance improvements. We intro-
duce a model which uses a deep recurrent auto encoder
neural network to denoise input features for robust ASR.
The model is trained on stereo (noisy and clean) audio
features to predict clean features given noisy input. The
model makes no assumptions about how noise affects the
signal, nor the existence of distinct noise environments.
Instead, the model can learn to model any type of distor-
tion or additive noise given sufficient training data. We
demonstrate the model is competitive with existing fea-
ture denoising approaches on the Aurora2 task, and out-
performs a tandem approach where deep networks are
used to predict phoneme posteriors directly},

The account presented here suggests that memories are first stored via synaptic changes in the hippocampal system, that these changes support reinstatement of recent memories in the neocortex, that neocortical synapses change a little on each reinstatement, and that remote memory is based on accumulated neocortical changes. Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences. The hippocampal system permits rapid learning of new items without disrupting this structure, and reinstatement of new memories interleaves them with others to integrate them into structured neocortical memory systems.},

However, the provenance and age of the fossils have been much debated5, 6. Here we confirm that the Omo I and Omo II hominid fossils are from similar stratigraphic levels in Member I of the Kibish Formation, despite the view that Omo I is more modern in appearance than Omo II1, 2, 3. 40Ar/39Ar ages on feldspar crystals from pumice clasts within a tuff in Member I below the hominid levels place an older limit of 198 plusminus 14 kyr (weighted mean age 196 plusminus 2 kyr) on the hominids. A younger age limit of 104 plusminus 7 kyr is provided by feldspars from pumice clasts in a Member III tuff. Geological evidence indicates rapid deposition of each member of the Kibish Formation. Isotopic ages on the Kibish Formation correspond to ages of Mediterranean sapropels, which reflect increased flow of the Nile River, and necessarily increased flow of the Omo River. Thus the 40Ar/39Ar age measurements, together with the sapropel correlations, indicate that the hominid fossils have an age close to the older limit. Our preferred estimate of the age of the Kibish hominids is 195 plusminus 5 kyr, making them the earliest well-dated anatomically modern humans yet described.},

  Abstract                 = {The introduction of electricity monitors (in-home displays; IHDs), which show accurate and up-to-the-minute energy usage, is expected to lead to reduction in consumption. Studies of feedback on domestic electricity use have generally supported this view. However, such studies also demonstrate wide variation between households. Examining the heterogeneity of responses is essential for understanding the actual and potential effectiveness of IHDs and in order to target interventions effectively. To explore differences between households' responses to IHDs, we conducted a qualitative study with 21 households who had an IHD for more than six months. Of the 21, only four households continued to refer to the IHD and the findings suggest that attempts to reduce energy consumption were situated in wider social and physical contexts. Further, the participants demonstrated energy saving behaviour before and outside of IHD usage. The patterns of energy behaviours and attempts at electricity conservation could best be understood by categorising the households into three types: the Monitor Enthusiasts (20%), the Aspiring Energy Savers (60%) and the Energy Non-Engaged (20%). The factors of importance in energy behaviour differed between the categories. Financial savings contributed to efforts to reduce energy use but only up to boundaries which varied considerably between households. Social practices and social relationships appeared to constrain what actions households were prepared to undertake, illuminating aspects of inter-household variation. Within the household, all energy users were not equal and we found that women were particularly influential on energy use through their primary responsibility for domestic labour on behalf of the household. The implications of the findings for environmental campaigning are discussed.},

The paper reviews evaluation methods used internationally for both building thermal efficiency and building energy labelling and presents results from two discrete studies in South Australia on monitoring actual household energy consumption. In order to investigate the occupancy effect on household energy, monitored energy data collected from two different housing developments in South Australia were examined. The energy ratings for these homes are compliant with the national agreed protocols for thermal performance modelling of dwellings, where one set of homes is a group occupied by higher socio-economic groups and the other is low income public housing in a colder climate region with much poorer home energy ratings. The wide variation of actual household energy for the homes that have relatively similar thermal envelopes indicates a lack of meaningful use for actual household energy in disclosure of house energy performance. Therefore, it is argued that thermal modelling software used to rate homes appears a more useful application of a system of disclosure of energy performance than the use of energy bills.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy monitoring and smart grid applications have rapidly developed into a multi-billion dollar market. The continued growth and utility of monitoring technologies is predicated upon the ability to economically extract actionable information from acquired data streams. One of the largest roadblocks to effective analytics arises from the disparities of scale inherent in all aspects of data collection and processing. Managing these multifaceted dynamic range issues is crucial to the success of load monitoring and smart grid technology.

This thesis presents NilmDB, a comprehensive framework for energy monitoring applications. The NilmDB management system is a network-enabled database that supports efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of vast, timestamped data sets. It allows a flexible and powerful separation between on-site, high-bandwidth processing operations and off-site, low-bandwidth control and visualization. Specific analysis can be performed as data is acquired, or retroactively as needed, using short filter scripts written in Python and transferred to the monitor.

The NilmDB framework is used to implement a spectral envelope preprocessor, an integral part of many non-intrusive load monitoring workflows that extracts relevant harmonic information and provides significant data reduction. A robust approach to spectral envelope calculation is presented using a 4-parameter sinusoid fit.

A new physically-windowed sensor architecture for improving the dynamic range of non-intrusive data acquisition is also presented and demonstrated. The hardware architecture utilizes digital techniques and physical cancellation to track a large-scale main signal while maintaining the ability to capture small-scale variations.},

  Abstract                 = {With the global problems of diminishing fossil fuel reserves and climate change comes the need to reduce energy consumption. One approach in the domestic sector is to improve consumer understanding of how much energy is consumed by each of their household appliances. This empowers consumers to make educated decisions on how they can change their lifestyle in an effort to reduce their energy consumption. This report investigates how total household energy consumption can be disaggregated into individual appliances using low granularity data collected from a single point of measurement, such as a smart meter. First, this work discusses how this problem can be solved using combinatorial optimisation. Second, a novel approach is introduced using hidden Markov models to model each appliance. We show through empirical evaluation that our implementation of the hidden Markov model approach outperforms the combinatorial optimisation method. Our future work is then outlined to show how we plan to better model domestic appliances and therefore improve the accuracy of our approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), or energy disaggregation, is the process of using signal processing and machine learning to separate the energy consumption of a building into individual appliances. In recent years, a number of data sets have been released in order to evaluate such approaches, which contain both building-level and appliance-level energy data. However, these data sets typically cover less than 10 households due to the financial cost of such deployments, and are not released in a format which allows the data sets to be easily used by energy disaggregation researchers. To this end, the Dataport database was created by Pecan Street Inc, which contains 1 minute circuit-level and building-level electricity data from 722 households. Furthermore, the non-intrusive load monitoring toolkit (NILMTK) was released in 2014, which provides software infrastructure to support energy disaggregation research, such as data set parsers, benchmark disaggregation algorithms and accuracy metrics. This paper describes the release of a subset of the Dataport database in NILMTK format, containing one month of electricity data from 669 households. Through the release of this Dataport data in NILMTK format, we pose a challenge to the signal processing community to produce energy disaggregation algorithms which are both accurate and scalable.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring is the process of breaking down a household’s total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances. In this paper we propose an approach by which individual appliances are iteratively separated from the aggregate load. Our approach does not require training data to be collected by sub-metering individual appliances. Instead, prior models of general appliance types are tuned to specific appliance instances using only signatures extracted from the aggregate load. The tuned appliance models are used to estimate each appliance’s load, which is subsequently subtracted from the aggregate load. We evaluate our approach using the REDD data set, and show that it can disaggregate 35% of a typical household’s total energy consumption to an accuracy of 83% by only disaggregating three of its highest energy consuming appliances.},

Although there are a number of existing commercial systems for gathering energy use in a home, almost none can easily and safely be installed by a homeowner (especially for homes in the U.S.). Our approach leverages advances in magnetoresistive materials and circuit design to allow contactless operation by reliably sensing the magnetic field induced by the 60 Hz current and a closed loop circuit allows us to precisely infer the power consumption in real-time.

  Abstract                 = {Britain’s smart meter upgrade is gathering pace, and those who’ve already
got their smart meter are giving the technology a big thumbs-up.
This report for Smart Energy GB, conducted by independent research
company Populus, has found that 84 per cent of people with smart meters
would recommend one to others.

Smart meters will bring an end to estimated bills and provide accurate
information about what we’re spending in pounds and pence in near real
time. Helping us all to use the amount of energy we want, without worrying
about the shock of an unknown bill.

Smart meters will also open the door to smarter grids and future innovation
with smart appliances and tariffs. The national upgrade represents a vital
digitisation of the energy industry, replacing analogue technology which
creates confusion and inaccuracy – the mechanical meters that haven’t
changed much since the 19th century.

Every home and microbusiness in Great Britain will have the opportunity
to upgrade to a smart meter by 2020. Smart meters will be installed by
energy suppliers, at no extra cost to consumers, and more than 1.6 million
have already been fitted across Scotland, England and Wales.

Smart energy outlook is published twice a year by Smart Energy GB. The
research is a snapshot of the real views and experiences of the British
public: how they feel about their gas and electricity, how those who already
have their smart meters are finding the new technology, and the impact
this transformation of our national infrastructure is having on their lives.

Key findings:
• More than eight in ten (84 per cent) of people with a smart meter
would recommend one to others.
• Nearly eight in ten (79 per cent) of smart meter customers have taken
steps to use less energy such as turning off lights, turning their heating
down or changing the way they use household appliances.
• People with smart meters feel more informed and in control of their
energy use. More than eight in ten (82 per cent) feel they have a better
idea of what they are spending on energy and nearly seven in ten (69
per cent) say they are more conscious about the energy that they use.
• Smart meter customers are also more confident in the accuracy of
their bills. Nearly four in five (79 per cent) believe that their energy bills
are accurate, whereas only 59 per cent of those without a smart meter
feel the same.

Research methodology: Populus conducted 10,101 interviews using a bespoke online survey,
designed to be representative of the population in Great Britain. The
interviews took place between 18th May and 1st June 2015.},

  Abstract                 = {Under European Directives, all member states are required to install 'intelligent metering systems' - smart meters - to at least 80% of domestic electricity consumers by 2020. The UK Government has opted for a more challenging programme, with plans for energy suppliers to install smart electricity and gas meters in all homes and smaller non-domestic premises in Great Britain by 2019. We welcome the introduction of smart meters, but have concerns over the way the programme has been planned. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (the Department) estimates that the smart meters programme will cost some £11.7 billion. This is a large complex programme requiring replacing around 53 million gas and electricity meters with significant uncertainties over the estimated costs and benefits involved.

In particular, it is far from certain that all consumers will benefit from the regulatory requirement placed on suppliers to install smart meters in their homes. We recognise however that the Department will work to ensure that consumers do benefit from being able to monitor their energy costs. The costs of installing smart meters will be borne by consumers through their energy bills, but many of the benefits accrue in the first instance to energy suppliers. No transparent mechanism presently exists for ensuring savings to the supplier are passed on to consumers, and the track record of energy companies to date does not inspire confidence that this will happen.

The Department has acknowledged that it is accountable for delivering the programme, keeping the costs down and ensuring that consumers benefit through reduced bills from the lower costs borne by suppliers and reduced energy use. The Department insists that suppliers are best placed to deliver the programme and that competition between energy suppliers is the best way to ensure consumers benefit from suppliers' savings. We are concerned, however, that past performance suggests that competition does not work effectively in this market and should not be relied on to keep prices low.

There remain significant uncertainties in a number of key areas in the programme. Consumers may not be willing to cooperate with the installation of smart meters: the communications programme which is promised for 2012 is therefore absolutely vital to help consumers use smart meters to reduce consumption. Significant practical difficulties may arise in procuring and installing the required data communications service before the planned roll-out of smart meters in 2014 (at a projected cost of £3 billion). The Department needs to address remaining uncertainties by conducting proper trials to identify and manage the risks associated with an IT project involving such a substantial amount of money which is financed by individuals as consumers.

The Department needs to ensure that the vulnerable, those on low incomes and those who use prepayment meters also benefit from smart meters. It would be unacceptable if these consumers bore the costs of smart meters through higher charges without getting a share of the potential benefits. The Government must put in place measures to ensure vulnerable people are not readily disconnected if they fall behind with payments.

There are issues around cyber security which need to be addressed if confidence in this new technology is to be gained by the population who are expected to have smart meters in their home and pay for them.

On the basis of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, we took evidence from the Department on preparations for the roll-out of smart meters, including the procurement of the Data Communications Service.},

concerns about the ambition of the programme, its risks and the extent of the potential
benefits to consumers. In two reports PAC considered the challenges associated with roll-out
‘huge’ and the benefits slim. DECC stated in May 2013 that it now expects suppliers to be
ready to start their full scale roll-out by autumn 2015, for completion by 2020.
Issues that may be of concern to constituents include the extent to which smart meters will
be mandated, consumer protection during the installation process, and concerns about
privacy and access to smart metering data. Suppliers must operate in line with an installation
code of practice which came into force on 1 June 2013, backed by legislation. Among other
things, this bans face-to-face marketing activity of specific products without prior consent
during installations, with a complete ban on completing any sales. On data access, energy
suppliers will be able to access consumption data on a monthly basis, with a clear consumer
opt-out for daily access by suppliers and an opt-in for more frequent access. Concerns have
also been raised by some groups about health effects from smart meters.
The licence conditions for the roll-out of gas and electricity smart metering equipment and a
code of practice for the installation of smart metering equipment came into force on
30 November 2012. Licence conditions relating to other aspects of the smart metering rollout
including a consumer engagement strategy most of those relating to data access and
privacy came into force on 4 March 2013.},

  Abstract                 = {Past societies have reacted when they understood that their own
activities were causing deleterious environmental change by controlling
or modifying the offending activities. The scientific evidence has now
become overwhelming that human activities, especially the combustion
of fossil fuels, are influencing the climate in ways that threaten the
well-being and continued development of human society. If humanity
is to learn from history and to limit these threats, the time has come
for stronger control of the human activities that are changing the
fundamental conditions for life on Earth.
To decide on effective control measures, an understanding of how
human activities are changing the climate, and of the implications of
unchecked climate change, needs to be widespread among world and
national leaders, as well as in the public.
The purpose of this report is to provide, for a broad range of audiences, an update of the newest understanding of climate change caused
by human activities, the social and environmental implications of
this change, and the options available for society to respond to the
challenges posed by climate change.},

for training deterministic auto-encoders. We
show that by adding a well chosen penalty
term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those
attained by other regularized auto-encoders
as well as denoising auto-encoders
on a range of datasets. This penalty term
corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the
Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations
with respect to the input. We show that
this penalty term results in a localized space
contraction which in turn yields robust features
on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to
both regularized auto-encoders and denoising
auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link
between deterministic and non-deterministic
auto-encoders. We nd empirically that this
penalty helps to carve a representation that
better captures the local directions of variation
dictated by the data, corresponding to a
lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while
being more invariant to the vast majority of
directions orthogonal to the manifold.
Finally, we show that by using the learned
features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state
of the art classication error on a range of
datasets, surpassing other methods of pre-training.},

  Abstract                 = {Smart meters report power usage at 15 minute intervals and, compared to monthly power
bills, provide the users with a much finer resolution time series of energy usage. However, apart
from identifying times of peak energy usage, these smart meters provide little actionable data for
the user in terms of reducing their power costs. Our research involves the development of an
intelligent metering system that uses non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) to
identify the largest energy usage appliances in a residence or small business. The signal
processing algorithms employed separate the energy used by individual appliances from the total
natural gas and electricity measured at the point where the utilities enter the residence. Utility
ratepayers need detailed information to effectively identify and mitigate inefficient appliances
and activities. The cost to operate each specific appliance is sent, via a secure home area
network, to the user’s computer and accessed via a web browser. An easy to use interactive tool
has been developed to label appliances and present this data to the user. Tests have been
performed in three residences to compare the performance of our load disaggregation system
with that of isolated electrical power measurements from ten or more appliances. Disaggregating
the total energy usage into appliance specific usage will transform ratepayers’ ability to conserve
energy. Inefficient appliances can be identified, usage patterns can be shifted to lower tariffs
times, failing appliances can be detected before they fail, and energy efficient measures can be
implemented based on a true cost-benefit calculation.},

The implementation of classification capability in future transient recorders will enable such features as selective storage of transient data (to better utilize limited storage media) and automated reporting of disturbances to central control facilities. The wavelet transform provides an effective and efficient means of decomposing voltage and current signals of power system transients to detectable and discriminant features. Similarities of power system transients to wide-band signals in other domains, the simultaneous presence of a resonant frequency, its harmonics, and impulse (high-frequency, time-localized) components, make this technique extendible to other classification systems. The classification algorithm uses statistical pattern recognition on features derived from the extreme representation of the transient waveform after processing the transient waveform by a non-orthogonal, quadratic spline wavelet. Training and classification testing use simulated waveforms of a 200 mile, three-phase transmission line produced by the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). A simple Bayesian classifier identifies an unknown transient waveform as a capacitor switching or fault transient, and locates the point of disturbance from one of two possible locations on the transmission line. Due to the effectiveness of the wavelet transform preprocessing, the classification system currently performs at 100 percent accuracy on four transient classes.},

Training via backpropagation-through-time initially minimizes an unsupervised sparse reconstruction error; the loss function is then augmented with a discriminative term on the supervised classification. The depth implicit in the temporally-unrolled form allows the system to exhibit all the power of deep networks, while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters.
From an initially unstructured network the hidden units differentiate into categorical-units, each of which represents an input prototype with a well-defined class; and part-units representing deformations of these prototypes. The learned organization of the recurrent encoder is hierarchical: part-units are driven directly by the input, whereas the activity of categorical-units builds up over time through interactions with the part-units. Even using a small number of hidden units per layer, discriminative recurrent sparse auto-encoders achieve excellent performance on MNIST.},

  Abstract                 = {The success of demand side energy control in industries, mines and commercial buildings depends on factors like the energy sensitivity and awareness of the organisation as well as an accurate and effective measurement and monitoring of its electrical energy consumption. Demand side energy control also forms an important part in the research programs of many research organisations. Reliable data on energy consumption is therefore imperative for effective research in this field, as well as for the successful implementation of demand side management. Traditional load research instrumentation has involved intrusive techniques that require the installation of sensors on each of the individual components of the total load. A non-intrusive appliance load monitor is proposed in this paper to determine the energy consumption of individual appliances turning on or off or operating under continuously varying load conditions. This monitoring system, which is implemented by network pattern identification technology, is based on detailed analysis of the current and voltage of the total load, as measured at the interface of the power source. The approach has been developed to simplify the collection of energy consumption data by utilities, but also has other applications. It is called nonintrusive to contrast it with previous techniques for gathering appliance data, which require placing sensors on individual appliances, and hence an intrusion onto the energy consumer's property.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensing, monitoring and actuating systems are expected to play a key role in reducing buildings overall energy consumption. Leveraging sensor systems to support energy efficiency in buildings poses novel research challenges in monitoring space usage, controlling devices, interfacing with smart energy meters and communicating with the energy grid. In the attempt of reducing electricity consumption in buildings, identifying individual sources of energy consumption is key to generate energy awareness and improve efficiency of available energy resources usage. Previous work studied several non-intrusive load monitoring techniques to classify appliances; however, the literature lacks of an comprehensive system that can be easily installed in existing buildings to empower users profiling, benchmarking and recognizing loads in real-time. This has been a major reason holding back the practice adoption of load monitoring techniques. In this paper we present RECAP: RECognition of electrical Appliances and Profiling in real-time. RECAP uses a single wireless energy monitoring sensor easily clipped to the main electrical unit. The energy monitoring unit transmits energy data wirelessly to a local machine for data processing and storage. The RECAP system consists of three parts: (1) Guiding the user for profiling electrical appliances within premises and generating a database of unique appliance signatures; (2) Using those signatures to train an artificial neural network that is then employed to recognize appliance activities (3) Providing a Load descriptor to allow peer appliance benchmarking. RECAP addresses the need of an integrated and intuitive tool to empower building owners with energy awareness. Enabling real-time appliance recognition is a stepping-stone towards reducing energy consumption and allowing a number of major applications including load-shifting techniques, energy expenditure breakdown per appliance, detection of power hungry and faulty appliances, and recogn- - ition of occupant activity. This paper describes the system design and performance evaluation in domestic environment.},

  Abstract                 = {The feeling of being observed or merely participating in an experiment can affect individuals' behavior. Referred to as the Hawthorne effect, this inconsistently observed phenomenon can both provide insight into individuals' behavior and confound the interpretation of experimental manipulations. Here, we pursue both topics in examining how the Hawthorne effect emerges in a large field experiment focused on residential consumers' electricity use. These consumers received five postcards notifying, and then reminding, them of their participation in a study of household electricity use. We found evidence for a Hawthorne (study participation) effect, seen in a reduction of their electricity use--even though they received no information, instruction, or incentives to change. Responses to a follow-up survey suggested that the effect reflected heightened awareness of energy consumption. Consistent with that interpretation, the treatment effect vanished when the intervention ended.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the great societal challenges that we face today concerns the move to more sustainable patterns of energy consumption, reflecting the need to balance both individual consumer choice and societal demands. In order for this energy turnaround' to take place, however, reducing residential energy consumption must go beyond using energy-efficient devices: More sustainable behaviour and lifestyles are essential parts of future energy aware' living. Addressing this issue from an HCI perspective, this paper presents the results of a 3-year research project dealing with the co-design and appropriation of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that has been rolled out in a living lab setting with seven households for a period of 18 months. Our HEMS is inspired by feedback systems in Sustainable Interaction Design and allows the monitoring of energy consumption in real-time. In contrast to existing research mainly focusing on how technology can persuade people to consume less energy ( what technology does to people'), our study focuses on the appropriation of energy feedback systems ( what people do with technology') and how newly developed practices can become a resource for future technology design. Therefore, we deliberately followed an open research design. In keeping with this approach, our study uncovers various responses, practices and obstacles of HEMS use. We show that HEMS use is characterized by a number of different features. Recognizing the distinctive patterns of technology use in the different households and the evolutionary character of that use within the households, we conclude with a discussion of these patterns in relation to existing research and their meaning for the design of future HEMSs.},

  Abstract                 = {Uncertainty in the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) Arctic sea ice volume record is characterized. A range of observations and approaches, including in situ ice thickness measurements, ICESat retrieved ice thickness, and model sensitivity studies, yields a conservative estimate for October Arctic ice volume uncertainty of 1.35 × 103 km3 and an uncertainty of the ice volume trend over the 1979–2010 period of 1.0 × 103 km3 decade–1. A conservative estimate of the trend over this period is −2.8 × 103 km3 decade–1. PIOMAS ice thickness estimates agree well with ICESat ice thickness retrievals (<0.1 m mean difference) for the area for which submarine data are available, while difference outside this area are larger. PIOMAS spatial thickness patterns agree well with ICESat thickness estimates with pattern correlations of above 0.8. PIOMAS appears to overestimate thin ice thickness and underestimate thick ice, yielding a smaller downward trend than apparent in reconstructions from observations. PIOMAS ice volume uncertainties and trends are examined in the context of climate change attribution and the declaration of record minima. The distribution of 32 year trends in a preindustrial coupled model simulation shows no trends comparable to those seen in the PIOMAS retrospective, even when the trend uncertainty is accounted for. Attempts to label September minima as new record lows are sensitive to modeling error. However, the September 2010 ice volume anomaly did in fact exceed the previous 2007 minimum by a large enough margin to establish a statistically significant new record.},

But recent studies are showing that the tropics are also changing. Several lines of evidence show that over the past few decades the tropical belt has expanded. This expansion has potentially important implications for subtropical societies and may lead to profound changes in the global climate system. Most importantly, poleward movement of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as jet streams and storm tracks, could result in shifts in precipitation patterns affecting natural ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources. The implications of the expansion for stratospheric circulation and the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere are as yet poorly understood. The observed recent rate of expansion is greater than climate model projections of expansion over the twenty-first century, which suggests that there is still much to be learned about this aspect of global climate change.},

Our multidisciplinary research is being undertaken in a set of nominally identical townhouses in Twin Rivers, New Jersey, a recently built community of standard construction with gas space heating, electric central air conditioning, and a full set of appliances.

Average levels of energy consumption and their dependence on weather and building type have been established, thereby permitting detailed quantitative studies of the sources of remaining variability. Starting from this baseline, we have established the level of change in energy consumption that followed the “energy crisis” in the autumn of 1973 and we have performed two kinds of controlled experiments: (1) experiments where a set of modifications (retrofits) are made to the building structure, and (2) experiments where “feedback” is provided to residents, on a regular basis, reporting their level of consumption of energy. Conclusions drawn from our modeling and experimentation are presented here, with emphasis given to those results bearing directly on the character of programs to retrofit the national housing stock.

Photographs of the site, of building defects, and of our retrofits are included, as well as a selection of graphical displays of data, each a snapshot of a kind of analysis we have found useful and are prepared to recommend to others who wish to help develop an understanding of how houses work.

Lists are included both of the program's reports and publications and of the people who have contributed to the Twin Rivers program since its inception.},

But at the global level, the correlation between increased wealth and increased energy consumption is very strong and the impact of policies to reduce energy demand is both limited and contested. Different academic disciplines approach energy demand reduction in different ways: emphasising some mechanisms and neglecting others, being more or less optimistic about the potential for reducing energy demand and providing insights that are more or less useful for policymakers. This article provides an overview of the main issues and challenges associated with energy demand reduction, summarises how this challenge is ‘framed’ by key academic disciplines, indicates how these can provide complementary insights for policymakers and argues that a ‘sociotechnical’ perspective can provide a deeper understanding of the nature of this challenge and the processes through which it can be achieved. The article integrates ideas from the natural sciences, economics, psychology, innovation studies and sociology but does not give equal weight to each. It argues that reducing energy demand will prove more difficult than is commonly assumed and current approaches will be insufficient to deliver the transformation required.},

  Abstract                 = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

  Abstract                 = {We integrate the recently proposed spatial transformer network (SPN) [Jaderberg et. al 2015] into a recurrent neural network (RNN) to form an RNN-SPN model. We use the RNN-SPN to classify digits in cluttered MNIST sequences. The proposed model achieves a single digit error of 1.5% compared to 2.9% for a convolutional networks and 2.0% for convolutional networks with SPN layers. The SPN outputs a zoomed, rotated and skewed version of the input image. We investigate different down-sampling factors (ratio of pixel in input and output) for the SPN and show that the RNN-SPN model is able to down-sample the input images without deteriorating performance. The down-sampling in RNN-SPN can be thought of as adaptive down-sampling that minimizes the information loss in the regions of interest. We attribute the superior performance of the RNN-SPN to the fact that it can attend to a sequence of regions of interest.},

spectral parameter vector and its dynamic feature vectors. In the
algorithm, we assume that the state sequence (state and mixture sequence
for the multi-mixture case) or a part of the state sequence
is unobservable (i.e., hidden or latent). As a result, the algorithm
iterates the forward-backward algorithm and the parameter generation
algorithm for the case where state sequence is given. Experimental
results show that by using the algorithm, we can reproduce
clear formant structure from multi-mixture HMMs as compared
with that produced from single-mixture HMMs.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method is proposed for modelling state duration in hidden Markov model (HMM) speech recognition systems. State transition probabilities are expressed conditional on how long the current state has been occupied. The conventional fixed-state transition probabilities aij are replaced by duration-dependent variables aij(d) that depend on the time d already spent in state i. In this way, state transition and state duration probabilities are combined to form duration-dependent transition probabilities. The transition probabilities are derived from the cumulative density function (CDF) of state duration. The training of \{HMMs\} with duration-dependent transitions are based on maximum likelihood segmentation of training data, using the Viterbi algorithm. At each training iteration, the current \{HMM\} parameters are used to segment every training example. All the segments associated with each state are then used to update state observation and transition parameters. In experiments with a data set of spoken English alphabet, durational modelling improves the recognition accuracy by 5.6%.},

Frustrated by a sense of global mispriorities, I blurted out some snarky and mildly regrettable tweets on the lack of attention to climate change in the tech industry (Twitter being a sublime medium for the snarky and regrettable). Climate change is the problem of our time, it’s everyone’s problem, and most of our problem-solvers are assuming that someone else will solve it.

I’m grateful to one problem-solver, who wrote to ask for specifics —

“How do you think the tech community (startup community, or any community) can contribute to tech and/or policy solutions on a global scale?”

The notes below are my attempt to answer that question.

This is a “personal view”, biased by my experiences and idiosyncrasies. I’ve followed the climate situation for some time, including working on Al Gore’s book Our Choice, but I can’t hope to convey the full picture — just a sliver that’s visible from where I’m standing. I urge you to talk to many scientists and engineers involved in climate analysis and energy, and see for yourself what the needs are and how you can contribute.

This is aimed at people in the tech industry, and is more about what you can do with your career than at a hackathon. I’m not going to discuss policy and regulation, although they’re no less important than technological innovation. A good way to think about it, via Saul Griffith, is that it’s the role of technologists to create options for policy-makers.

I’m also only going to directly discuss technology related to the primary cause of climate change (the burning of fossil fuels), although there are technological needs related to other causes (livestock, deforestation, global poverty), as well as mitigating symptoms of climate change (droughts and storms, ecosystem damage, mass migrations).

This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes to compare the performance of neural network classifiers between back propagation (BP) and learning vector quantization (LVQ) for pattern analyses of features selection in a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) system. Load recognition for identifying loads being connected and disconnected is applied to a NILM by using a neural network, especially for industrial electrical loads, even though some loads are activated at the nearly same time. In order to accurately decompose the aggregate load into its components, a feature-based model for describing the signatures of individual appliances and load combinations is used. The model will suggest the certain signatures which can be detected for all loads in order to indicate the activities of the separate components. To verify the performance of the model for the features selection, the data sets of the electrical loads and the load recognition techniques apply an electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and a neural network, respectively. The effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition are analyzed and compared by using the back propagation classifier and the learning vector quantization classifier. To obtain a maximum recognition accuracy rate, the calculation of the turn-on transient energy signature employs a window of samples, At, to adaptively segment a transient representative of a class of loads. Experiments performed with a variety of model data sets which reveal the back propagation classifier is superior to the learning quantization classifier in the effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition.},

  Abstract                 = {Implementation of smart grid provides an opportunity for concurrent implementation of nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM), which disaggregates the total household electricity data into data on individual appliances. This paper introduces a new disaggregation algorithm for NIALM based on a modified Viterbi algorithm. This modification takes advantage of the sparsity of transitions between appliances' states to decompose the main algorithm, thus making the algorithm complexity linearly proportional to the number of appliances. By consideration of a series of data and integrating a priori information, such as the frequency of use and time on/time off statistics, the algorithm dramatically improves NIALM accuracy as compared to the accuracy of established NIALM algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we address both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. This enables us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky \etal on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},
