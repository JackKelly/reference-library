  Abstract                 = {Synaptic plasticity provides the basis for most models of learning, memory and development in neural circuits. To generate realistic results, synapse-specific Hebbian forms of plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and depression, must be augmented by global processes that regulate overall levels of neuronal and network activity. Regulatory processes are often as important as the more intensively studied Hebbian processes in determining the consequences of synaptic plasticity for network function. Recent experimental results suggest several novel mechanisms for regulating levels of activity in conjunction with Hebbian synaptic modification. We review three of them—synaptic scaling, spike-timing dependent plasticity and synaptic redistribution—and discuss their functional implications.},

  Abstract                 = {Changepoints are abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed an algorithm to disaggregate short-interval (hourly) whole-building electrical load into major end uses. Hourly load data, hourly load-temperature regression coefficients and simulation end-use results comprise the algorithm input. The algorithm produces hourly load profiles for air conditioning, lighting, fans and pumps, and miscellaneous loads. Measured data from two end-use metered buildings (an office and a retail store) have been used to validate the algorithm. For the retail store, the algorithm estimates of hourly end use compare remarkably well with the monitored end-use data (average error of less than 5% during daytime operation). For the office building, the algorithm gives a consistent bias of about 12 and 27% in overestimating the HVAC and lighting electric loads, respectively, at the expense of underestimating the miscellaenous load by 35%. Results may be attributed to the presence of inconsistencies between office audit information and measured end-use data. A three-fold difference between the auditor's estimate for miscellaneous energy use and the metered amount has been found. The validation, however, indicates great promise for application of the algorithm to whole-building load data for obtaining reliable end-use data.},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring the health of the elderly living independently in their own homes is a key issue in building sustainable healthcare models which support a country's ageing population. Existing approaches have typically proposed remotely monitoring the behaviour of a household's occupants through the use of additional sensors. However the costs and privacy concerns of such sensors have significantly limited their potential for widespread adoption. In contrast, in this paper we propose an approach which detects Activities of Daily Living, which we use as a proxy for the health of the household residents. Our approach detects appliance usage from existing smart meter data, from which the unique daily routines of the household occupants are learned automatically via a log Gaussian Cox process. We evaluate our approach using two real-world data sets, and show it is able to detect over 80% of kettle uses while generating less than 10% false positives. Furthermore, our approach allows earlier interventions in households with a consistent routine and fewer false alarms in the remaining households, relative to a fixed-time intervention benchmark.},

  Abstract                 = {Disaggregating total household's energy data down to individual appliances via non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NALM) has generated renewed interest with ongoing or planned large-scale smart meter deployments worldwide. Of special interest are NALM algorithms that are of low complexity and operate in near real time, supporting emerging applications such as in-home displays, remote appliance scheduling and home automation, and use low sampling rates data from commercial smart meters. NALM methods, based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and its variations, have become the state of the art due to their high performance, but suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we develop an alternative approach based on support vector machine (SVM) and k-means, where k-means is used to reduce the SVM training set size by identifying only the representative subset of the original dataset for the SVM training. The resulting scheme outperforms individual k-means and SVM classifiers and shows competitive performance to the state-of-the-art HMM-based NALM method with up to 45 times lower execution time (including training and testing).},

SensorAct is designed to scale from small homes to network of buildings, making it suitable not only for production use but to also seed a global-scale network of building testbeds with appropriately constrained and policed access.

Second, billions of dollars are being spent to install smart meters, yet the energy saving and financial benefits of this infrastructure – without careful consideration of the human element – will not reach its full potential. We believe that we can address these problems by strategically marrying them, using disaggregation. Disaggregation refers to a set of statistical approaches for extracting end-use and/or appliance level data from an aggregate, or whole-building, energy signal. In this paper, we explain how appliance level data affords numerous benefits, and why using the algorithms in conjunction with smart meters is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for getting this data. We review disaggregation algorithms and their requirements, and evaluate the extent to which smart meters can meet those requirements.

  Abstract                 = {Recent weeks have seen a political furore around the future of so-called “green levies” on energy bills,
including the ECO. The current debate is largely ill-informed and driven by energy suppliers with a
vested interest in removing obligations that compel them to help their customers save energy. This
briefing pack provides a series of arguments, backed up by evidence, that show why it is necessary to
retain and improve the ECO. First, energy efficiency is the best way to prevent bills spiralling out of
control. Comparing a range of policy options shows that installing energy efficiency measures could
save a typical household over £500 each year, compared to the temporary £72 a year promised by Ed
Miliband through a price freeze, and the meagre £2.44 offered by the government’s tariff reform.
Scrapping the ECO, meanwhile, would only save £47 on a typical annual duel fuel bill.
Furthermore, the UK is currently one of the worst countries in Europe for energy efficiency. We
can learn from cases of best practice such as Sweden, which show that improving the UK’s housing
stock would bring major benefits to householders, making energy bills more affordable and creating
warmer, healthier homes. In the UK, there are still very significant opportunities for the
installation of measures. Our review of remaining potential shows that opportunities for measures
are certainly not a barrier to wide-scale and cost-effective energy efficiency schemes – contrary to some
DECC statements. While past ECO-type schemes have been running successfully for 20 years, and have
helped around half of UK homes, it is now essential to finish the job, and ensure that all homes are
protected from rising gas and electricity prices. Cutting the ECO now would be deeply unfair to these
people who have not yet received help.
Some might argue that while promoting energy efficiency is important, the ECO is not the best way to
achieve this. However, the ECO is currently the only realistic policy option for promoting energy
efficiency across Great Britain. DECC’s latest figures show that to the end of September 2013, 98% of 
all measures delivered through energy efficiency policies were delivered by the ECO1. While publicly
funded schemes are also valuable (alongside supplier obligations like the ECO), these schemes often
experience fluctuations in funding year-by-year, creating a climate of uncertainty for the industry. A
publicly-funded grant scheme, Warm Front, was recently scrapped and a new scheme of this kind is
highly improbable in the near future. Therefore, the idea of funding the ECO through general taxation is
a red herring, and may be being used by energy companies as a cover for lobbying against the ECO.
We also show that the ECO is essential in tackling fuel poverty. Making homes highly energy
efficient is by far the best solution to end fuel poverty. Policies promoting energy efficiency will mean
that, in 2015, the average annual bill for a low income household will be £73 lower than it would be
without the policies. These savings become greater in succeeding years. However, current spending to
tackle fuel poverty through energy efficiency, even before cutbacks to the ECO are contemplated, is only
one eighth of what it needs to be to effectively deal with the problem. Given that the Prime Minister
wrote personally to the chairman of the government’s Fuel Poverty Advisory Group in January2 to
reaffirm his commitment to ending fuel poverty in England by 2016, it is incumbent on him to
strengthen, not weaken the ECO.
In addition, we show that cutting or scrapping the ECO would have disastrous consequences for
employment. Scrapping the ECO would result in the loss of 32,000 jobs in 2014 and would have a
disastrous effect on investor confidence. A range of business and industry representatives have written
to the government to express grave concerns over the current climate of uncertainty, and to call for the
ECO to be retained and improved. We show that the ECO can be improved through a combination of
simple cost-cutting changes and a refocusing on lower cost insulation measures. Specifically, the
ECO should be improved through these simple cost-cutting measures:
 Take carry-over from CERT into account in total cost expectations
 ‘Deemed savings’ to reduce risk and simplify customer proposition
 Price cap on Hard to Treat Cavities in ECO CERO (to stop windfalls)
 Price cap on ECO CERO (to make up for market failure)
 Introduce a solid wall insulation minimum target into ECO and increase Government cashback
for solid wall insulations to avoid ECO paying for supply chain development
Crucially, this should be combined with a change in parameters to refocus the ECO onto lower cost
insulation improvements. This will ensure we can meet the ECO’s goals and support insulation
industry jobs whilst reducing uncertainty in the cost of delivery. Taken in combination, these
improvements offer a realistic way to maintain and develop the ECO, while minimising costs.
These evidence-based arguments combine to present a clear conclusion: the ECO has a vital role to play
in reducing energy bills, tackling fuel poverty and building a strong and sustainable energy efficiency
sector. Now more than ever, the government must maintain a consistent and ambitious energy
efficiency obligation on suppliers, in order to protect consumers from price rises and ensure the UK’s
future prosperity and wellbeing.

The approach is based on the embedding of multivariate time series data associated with normal process conditions, followed by the extraction of features from the resulting lagged trajectory matrix. The features are extracted by recasting the data into a binary classification problem, which can be solved with a random forest model. A proximity matrix can be calculated from the model and from this matrix features can be extracted that represent the trajectory of the system in phase space. The results of the study suggest that the random forest approach may afford distinct advantages over a previously proposed linear equivalent, particularly when complex nonlinear systems need to be monitored.},

The prediction performance and the ability to characterize the residential end-use energy consumption of the \{CDA\} model are compared with those of a neural network (NN) and an engineering based model developed earlier. The comparison of the predictions of the models indicates that \{CDA\} is capable of accurately predicting the energy consumption in the residential sector as well as the other two models. The effects of socio-economic factors are estimated using the \{NN\} and the \{CDA\} models, where possible. Due to the limited number of variables the \{CDA\} model can accommodate, its capability to evaluate these effects is found to be lower than the \{NN\} model.},

  Abstract                 = {Smart meter deployments are spurring renewed interest in analysis techniques for electricity usage data. An important prerequisite for data analysis is characterizing and modeling how electrical loads use power. While prior work has made significant progress in deriving insights from electricity data, one issue that limits accuracy is the use of general and often simplistic load models. Prior models often associate a fixed power level with an “on” state and either no power, or some minimal amount, with an “off” state. This paper’s goal is to develop a new methodology for modeling electric loads that is both simple and accurate. Our approach is empirical in nature: we monitor a wide variety of common loads to distill a small number of common usage characteristics, which we leverage to construct accurate load-specific models. We show that our models are significantly more accurate than binary on-off models, decreasing the root mean square error by as much as 8X for representative loads. Finally, we demonstrate two example uses of our models in data analysis: i) generating device-accurate synthetic traces of building electricity usage, and ii) filtering out loads that generate rapid and random power variations in building electricity data},

  Abstract                 = {Buildings across the world contribute significantly to the overall energy consumption. Targeted feedback can help occupants optimise energy consumption. In our first work we present techniques for actionable feedback across fridges and air conditioning (HVAC) units, which can save upto 25% of fridge energy and identify homes needing feedback on HVAC setpoint schedule with 84% accuracy. In our next work, we do an extensive sensor deployment in a home in Delhi, India; monitoring appliance level power, home aggregate power and other ambient parameters. Our study presents various insights unseen in the developed world, such as: frequent voltage brownouts, poor network reliability, long lasting blackouts, heavy dominance of fridge and HVAC to overall energy consumption. Our study verifies that measuring appliance level power scales poorly in cost and maintenance. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is viewed as a viable alternative where machine learning techniques are used to break down aggregate household energy consumption into contributing appliances. Despite the existence of a rich volume of literature in NILM, it remained virtually impossible to compare NILM works due to: i) lack of existence of benchmarks; ii) previous work tested on single data set; iii) inconsistent metrics. To address these challenges we developed an open source toolkit: Non-intrusive load monitoring toolkit (NILMTK), designed specifically to enable the comparison of NILM algorithms. While many new NILM techniques have been proposed in recent times, it is not clear if these can enable energy saving and whether higher accuracy translates to higher energy saving. We explore these questions in our recent work and find that existing energy disaggregation techniques do not provide power traces with sufficient fidelity to support the feedback techniques we developed in our earlier work. Our results indicate a need to revisit the metrics by which disaggregation is evaluated.},

Dominant electricity consumption within the buildings, contributed by plug loads, lighting and air conditioning, can be significantly improved using Occupancy-based Building Management Systems (Ob-BMS). In this paper, we address three critical aspects of Ob-BMS i.e. 1) Modular sensor node design to support diverse deployment scenarios; 2) Building architecture to support and scale fine resolution monitoring; and 3) Detailed analysis of the collected data for smarter actuation. We present key learning across these three aspects evolved over more than one year of design and deployment experiences. The sensor node design evolved over a period of time to address specific deployment requirements. With an opportunity at the host institute where two dorm buildings were getting constructed, we planned for the support infrastructure required for fine resolution monitoring embedded in the design phase and share our preliminary experiences and key learning thereof. Prototype deployment of the sensing system as per the planned support infrastructure was performed at two faculty offices with effective data collection worth 45 days. Collected data is analyzed accounting for efficient switching of appliances, in addition to energy conservation and user comfort as performed in the earlier occupancy based frameworks. Our analysis shows that occupancy prediction using simple heuristic based modeling can achieve similar performance as more complex Hidden Markov Models, thus simplifying the analytic framework.},

  Abstract                 = {Residential buildings contribute significantly to the overall energy consumption across most parts of the world. While smart monitoring and control of appliances can reduce the overall energy consumption, management and cost associated with such systems act as a big hindrance. Prior work has established that detailed feedback in the form of appliance level consumption to building occupants improves their awareness and paves the way for reduction in electricity consumption. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), i.e. the process of disaggregating the overall home electricity usage measured at the meter level into constituent appliances, provides a simple and cost effective methodology to provide such feedback to the occupants. In this paper we present Improved Non-Intrusive load monitoring using load Division and Calibration (INDiC) that simplifies NILM by dividing the appliances across multiple instrumented points (meters/phases) and calibrating the measured power. Proposed approach is used together with the Combinatorial Optimization framework and evaluated on the popular REDD dataset. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvement in disaggregation accuracy, achieved by using INDiC based Combinatorial Optimization, demonstrate significant improvement in disaggregation accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation, aims to disaggregate a household's electricity consumption into constituent appliances. More than three decades of work in NILM has resulted in the development of several novel algorithmic approaches. However, despite these advancements, two core challenges still exist: i) disaggregating low power consumption appliances and ii) distinguishing between multiple instances of similar appliances. These challenges are becoming increasingly important due to an increasing number of appliances and increased usage of electronics in homes. Previous approaches have attempted to solve these problems using expensive hardware involving high sampling rates better suited to laboratory settings, or using additional number of sensors, limiting the ease of deployment. In this work, we explore using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) power line communication (PLC) modems as an inexpensive and easy to deploy alternative solution to these problems. We use the reduction in bandwidth between two PLC modems, caused due to the change in PLC modulation scheme when different appliances are operated as a signature for an appliance. Since the noise generated in the powerline is dependent both on type and location of an appliance, we believe that our technique based on PLC modems can be a promising addition for solving NILM.},

Building upon more than a year of experience in sensor network deployments, we undertake an extensive deployment in a three storey home in Delhi, spanning 73 days from May-August 2013, measuring electrical, water and ambient parameters. We used 33 sensors across the home, measuring these parameters, collecting a total of approx. 400 MB of data daily. We discuss the architectural implications on the deployment systems that can be used for monitoring and control in the context of developing countries. Addressing the unreliability of electrical grid and internet in such settings, we present Sense Local-store Upload architecture for robust data collection. While providing several unique aspects, our deployment further validates the common considerations from similar residential deployments, discussed previously in the literature.

This work is the first research to compare multiple disaggregation approaches across multiple publicly available data sets. Our toolkit includes parsers for a range of existing data sets, a collection of preprocessing algorithms, a set of statistics for describing data sets, two reference benchmark disaggregation algorithms and a suite of accuracy metrics. We demonstrate the range of reproducible analyses which are made possible by our toolkit, including the analysis of six publicly available data sets and the evaluation of both benchmark disaggregation algorithms across such data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {A computer programme which aims to cut power wastage in low-income households has been launched after a trial in five east London boroughs.

The Shimmer system assesses a home's electricity consumption and recommends ways to make it more efficient, the Energy Saving Trust said.

It also connects to an online accounting tool to encourage budgeting.

The project could "help a lot of people in future", said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice.

Last week an independent report found thousands of people die each year from illnesses linked to fuel poverty.

Shimmer works by connecting electrical appliances to "smart" plugs which measure the amount of power used and provide an itemised bill showing how much each item costs to run.

The programme then suggests how to cut costs, for instance by recommending more efficient boilers or fridges, and lists appropriate benefits and allowances available to the user.
'Smart homes'

A total of 18 homes, most of which were in debt and had little disposable income, tried the system in Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge and Waltham Forest.

The savings for each ran into hundreds of pounds a year, the trust said.

"Ultimately, we need to have smart homes, not just smart meters," said chief executive Philip Sellwood.

Citizens Advice said increasing numbers of people were seeking information on cutting fuel bills and saving energy.

"Around Â£18bn of means-tested benefits and tax credits is unclaimed this year and this project shows that some of the biggest 'savings' for households came as a result of advice on financial issues and benefit entitlements people either did not know about, or did not think were for them," said Ms Guy.

"Combining that advice with new technology which puts customers in control of their energy usage could be a powerful combination to help a lot of people in future."},

  Abstract                 = {Activity recognition constitutes the key challenge in the development of smart home assistive systems. In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic method for activity recognition in a smart home, based on load signatures of appliances. Most recognition approaches rely on distributed and heterogeneous sensors (ex. RFID), which are intrusive require complex installation, deployment and maintenance. On the other hand, most applications of appliance load monitoring (signal analysis) refer to the energy saving and the costs reducing of energy consumption. Consequently, our proposal constitutes an original application and new algorithmic method based on steady-state operations and signatures. The extraction process of load signatures of appliances is carried out in a three-dimensional space through a single power analyzer, which is non-intrusive (NIALM). We have rigorously tested this new approach by conducting an experiment in our smart home prototype by simulating daily scenarios taken from clinical trials previously done with Alzheimer patients. The promising results we obtained are presented and compared to other approaches, showing that, with an exceptionally minimal investment and the exploitation of relatively limited data, our method can efficiently recognize activities of daily living for providing assistive services.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},

The articles reviewed suggest that educational robotics usually acts as an element that enhances learning, however, this is not always the case, as there are studies that have reported situations in which there was no improvement in learning. The outcomes of the literature review are discussed in terms of their implications for future research, and can provide useful guidance for educators, practitioners and researchers in the area.},

To better focus cost and resource conservation efforts, electricity consumption feedback can be used to provide motivation, guidance, and verification. Disaggregating by end-use helps both consumers and producers to identify targets for conservation. While hardware-based sub-metering is costly and labor-intensive, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is capable of gathering detailed energy-use data with minimal equipment cost and installation time. However, variations in measurements between metering devices complicate the process of compiling the necessary appliance profiles. Future work involves the development of \{NILM\} algorithms using sensor fusion and detailed appliance-level data gathered from a highly-sensed house currently being constructed near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.},

As a proof of concept, and in order to obtain preliminary data that would help us evaluate the feasibility of using NILM to support electricity audits in a residential building, we decided to focus our attention on one of the top residential loads: the refrigerator. We installed a NILM prototype system in an apartment building, and a plug-level power meter was used to accurately track the individual consumption of this appliance. The experiment consisted in monitoring this load for a week, using the two methodologies (NILM and pluglevel meters), and then comparing the estimated energy consumption as computed by each.},

A new non-intrusive load monitoring system (NIALMS) has been developed in this paper which is able to disaggregate the total active power to obtain appliance specific data. The underlying idea is to detect step changes in total active power consumption by a simple optimisation model.},

  Abstract                 = {The need to achieve a transition to a low carbon economy has renewed interest in "energy efficiency" and what has become known as "demand side management". This thesis investigates the role of measurement and modelling in the management of domestic electricity demand. Practice and policy have, since the 1950s, tended to favour a "supply paradigm" centred on the imperative of increasing energy supply. Despite the upheaval of market liberalisation, and twenty years of climate change debate, the domestic electricity "culture" has changed very little. The first half of this thesis contributes to this subject by describing the complex development of the electricity system that we are familiar with today. Drawing upon technical, social and political themes, the current and emerging practices of measurement, modelling, and management are critiqued. It is argued that current practices require revaluation, if alternative, decentralised approaches are to receive a fair analysis. The thesis contributes in empirical terms by extending the evidence base and developing modelling tools for the analysis of domestic electricity use. Field data collected by the author concerning the power flow characteristics of domestic appliances are presented which identify the dynamic nature of domestic electrical loads. A modelling framework is then introduced that combines social and technical aspects of domestic energy demand, allowing synthesis of domestic load profiles and allowing comparison between localised interventions.},

  Abstract                 = {The residential sector uses nearly 30% of all electricity in Canada, and, it is important to know how this energy is being used, so that savings may be identified and realised. We propose a method that can be applied to hourly whole-house electrical energy data to partially disaggregate total household electricity use into five load categories/parameters (base load, activity load, heating season gradient, cooling season gradient and lowest external temperature at which air-conditioning is used). This paper develops the proposed method, and verifies it using high-resolution end-use data from twelve households with known characteristics. We then apply the method to hourly whole-house (smart meter) data from 327 households in Ontario. The roll-out of smart (advanced) metering infrastructure in many countries will make hourly whole-house data abundant, and we propose that this method could be widely applied by utilities to target their demand-side management programs towards households more likely to provide benefits, thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of such programs.},

the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation:
the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness
and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining
powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development.
Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements
over intermediate representations.},

Two problems are examined. In the first problem the data is given in the traditional form of a string so the novel aspect is that insertions and deletions are now corrected. In the second problem, a unique string need not be given, but a regular language is given, and any string belonging to the regular language is a possible data string. Again, deletion addition, and changes of symbols are corrected. A direct generalization of the Viterbi decoding algorithm is thus proved to be an efficient technique for solving a much wider class of problems},

Interviews were carried out during the study and provided insight into social construction and social comparison processes occurring during the intervention as these are key to understanding the emergence and diffusion of social norms.

No-where is this more evident that in local government where municipalities are expected to lead on carbon reduction initiatives whilst operating in challenging political landscapes. This paper reflects on a UK Research Council funded case study exploring the role of engagement in a UK municipality. Innovative feedback tools and user-engagement were developed in an effort to foster a collaborative approach to energy management.

Findings from an analysis of a focus group and a set of semi-structured interviews show encouraging signs with regard to increased user-engagement and digital tools, but barriers remain with regards to the ‘real world’ implementation of innovative, and technologically grounded, approaches. These included a staff reduction programme amidst financial cuts, a risk-averse culture with regard to new technologies, and debate about where responsibilities lie with regards to energy management. While these findings were case specific they have implications for organisations contemplating how technology might support them in workplace engagement for reduced energy use.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks frorn data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented.

The main original contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms.},

Most carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the burning of fossil fuels will eventually be absorbed by the ocean1, with potentially adverse consequences for marine biota2, 3, 4. Here we quantify the changes in ocean pH that may result from this continued release of CO2 and compare these with pH changes estimated from geological and historical records. We find that oceanic absorption of CO2 from fossil fuels may result in larger pH changes over the next several centuries than any inferred from the geological record of the past 300 million years, with the possible exception of those resulting from rare, extreme events such as bolide impacts or catastrophic methane hydrate degassing.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Residential electricity users need more detail than monthly bills to reduce consumption. With the emergence of technologies that provide detailed usage estimates for energy consumption, two questions arise. First, how many different energy-consuming appliances contribute to household electricity load, and secondly which appliances? Using national average penetration rates, the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), estimates that 42 unique appliances account for 93% of electricity consumption, while 12 appliances account for 80% of average household electric load. A typical scenario is developed from national and regional penetration rates and find that eight appliances are responsible for 80% of a household's electric load in the United States. Four household scenarios are developed: a house that uses electric appliances, gas appliances, the average household, and typical household. It is concluded that RECS cannot be used as a representative household as it overestimates the number of appliances that contribute to a household electric load. The number of significant appliances is affected by appliance ownership and use, which is more variable between homes than between census divisions. These results can be used to design and maximize the value of residential energy information and management systems.},

Disaggregation-based solution with a maximum of 24% and a minimum of 3.5%. The international
study shows high levels of consumer engagement, favorable consumer reaction and an 80% approval
from users on making this solution available to all. These studies aim to support the introduction of

Our SELF implementation runs twice as fast as the fastest Smalltalk implementation, despite SELF's lack of classes and explicit variables. To compensate for the absence of classes, our system uses implementation-level maps to transparently group objects cloned from the same prototype, providing data type information and eliminating the apparent space overhead for prototype-based systems. To compensate for dynamic typing, user-defined control structures, and the lack of explicit variables, our system dynamically compiles multiple versions of a source method, each customized according to its receiver's map. Within each version the type of the receiver is fixed, and thus the compiler can statically bind and inline all messages sent to self. Message splitting and type prediction extract and preserve even more static type information, allowing the compiler to inline many other messages. Inlining dramatically improves performance and eliminates the need to hard-wire low-level methods such as +,==, and ifTrue:. Despite inlining and other optimizations, our system still supports interactive programming environments. The system traverses internal dependency lists to invalidate all compiled methods affected by a programming change. The debugger reconstructs inlined stack frames from compiler-generated debugging information, making inlining invisible to the SELF programmer.},

Additionally, in combination with electromagnetic transients program (EMTP) simulations and measurements on site, extracting the features of power signatures can lead to accurate load identifications and is a significant feature in smart meters.},

With characterizing associated transient energy signature, the reliability and accuracy of recognition results can be accurately understood or ascertained. In this study, the computer supported cooperative work techniques (CSCW), artificial neural networks (ANN), in combination with turn-on transient energy analysis, are used to identify loads and to improve recognition accuracy and computational speed of NILM results. The experimental results indicated that the incorporation of turn-on transient energy signature analysis into NILM revealed more information than traditional NILM methods, and the resulting recognition accuracy and computational speed were improved. In addition, in combination with computer supported cooperative work in electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) simulation, calculations of turn-on transient energy facilitated load identification that had significant effect on NILM results.},

However, monitoring occupancy directly is intrusive, typically requiring the deployment of multiple environmental sensors, e.g., motion, acoustic, CO2, etc. In this paper, we explore the potential for Non-Intrusive Occupancy Monitoring (NIOM) by using electricity data from smart meters to infer occupancy. We first observe that a home's pattern of electricity usage generally changes when occupants are present due to their interact with electrical loads. We empirically evaluate these interactions by monitoring ground truth occupancy in two homes, then correlating it with changes in statistical metrics of smart meter data, such as power's mean and variance, over short intervals. In particular, we use each metric's maximum value at night as a proxy for its maximum value in an unoccupied home, and then signal occupancy whenever the daytime value exceeds it. Our results highlight NIOM's potential and its challenges.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. The proposed RNN, gated-feedback RNN (GF-RNN), extends the existing approach of stacking multiple recurrent layers by allowing and controlling signals flowing from upper recurrent layers to lower layers using a global gating unit for each pair of layers. The recurrent signals exchanged between layers are gated adaptively based on the previous hidden states and the current input. We evaluated the proposed GF-RNN with different types of recurrent units, such as tanh, long short-term memory and gated recurrent units, on the tasks of character-level language modeling and Python program evaluation. Our empirical evaluation of different RNN units, revealed that in both tasks, the GF-RNN outperforms the conventional approaches to build deep stacked RNNs. We suggest that the improvement arises because the GF-RNN can adaptively assign different layers to different timescales and layer-to-layer interactions (including the top-down ones which are not usually present in a stacked RNN) by learning to gate these interactions.},

Here, we extend the reconstruction of global mean sea level back to 1870 and find a sea-level rise from January 1870 to December 2004 of 195 mm, a 20th century rate of sea-level rise of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm yr−1 and a significant acceleration of sea-level rise of 0.013 ± 0.006 mm yr−2. This acceleration is an important confirmation of climate change simulations which show an acceleration not previously observed. If this acceleration remained constant then the 1990 to 2100 rise would range from 280 to 340 mm, consistent with projections in the IPCC TAR.},

Here we show that different motor learning tasks induce dendritic Ca2+ spikes on different apical tuft branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex. These task-related, branch-specific Ca2+ spikes cause long-lasting potentiation of postsynaptic dendritic spines active at the time of spike generation. When somatostatin-expressing interneurons are inactivated, different motor tasks frequently induce Ca2+ spikes on the same branches. On those branches, spines potentiated during one task are depotentiated when they are active seconds before Ca2+ spikes induced by another task. Concomitantly, increased neuronal activity and performance improvement after learning one task are disrupted when another task is learned. These findings indicate that dendritic-branch-specific generation of Ca2+ spikes is crucial for establishing long-lasting synaptic plasticity, thereby facilitating information storage associated with different learning experiences.},

  Abstract                 = {Under European Directives, all member states are required to install 'intelligent metering systems' - smart meters - to at least 80% of domestic electricity consumers by 2020. The UK Government has opted for a more challenging programme, with plans for energy suppliers to install smart electricity and gas meters in all homes and smaller non-domestic premises in Great Britain by 2019. We welcome the introduction of smart meters, but have concerns over the way the programme has been planned. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (the Department) estimates that the smart meters programme will cost some £11.7 billion. This is a large complex programme requiring replacing around 53 million gas and electricity meters with significant uncertainties over the estimated costs and benefits involved.

In particular, it is far from certain that all consumers will benefit from the regulatory requirement placed on suppliers to install smart meters in their homes. We recognise however that the Department will work to ensure that consumers do benefit from being able to monitor their energy costs. The costs of installing smart meters will be borne by consumers through their energy bills, but many of the benefits accrue in the first instance to energy suppliers. No transparent mechanism presently exists for ensuring savings to the supplier are passed on to consumers, and the track record of energy companies to date does not inspire confidence that this will happen.

The Department has acknowledged that it is accountable for delivering the programme, keeping the costs down and ensuring that consumers benefit through reduced bills from the lower costs borne by suppliers and reduced energy use. The Department insists that suppliers are best placed to deliver the programme and that competition between energy suppliers is the best way to ensure consumers benefit from suppliers' savings. We are concerned, however, that past performance suggests that competition does not work effectively in this market and should not be relied on to keep prices low.

There remain significant uncertainties in a number of key areas in the programme. Consumers may not be willing to cooperate with the installation of smart meters: the communications programme which is promised for 2012 is therefore absolutely vital to help consumers use smart meters to reduce consumption. Significant practical difficulties may arise in procuring and installing the required data communications service before the planned roll-out of smart meters in 2014 (at a projected cost of £3 billion). The Department needs to address remaining uncertainties by conducting proper trials to identify and manage the risks associated with an IT project involving such a substantial amount of money which is financed by individuals as consumers.

The Department needs to ensure that the vulnerable, those on low incomes and those who use prepayment meters also benefit from smart meters. It would be unacceptable if these consumers bore the costs of smart meters through higher charges without getting a share of the potential benefits. The Government must put in place measures to ensure vulnerable people are not readily disconnected if they fall behind with payments.

There are issues around cyber security which need to be addressed if confidence in this new technology is to be gained by the population who are expected to have smart meters in their home and pay for them.

On the basis of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, we took evidence from the Department on preparations for the roll-out of smart meters, including the procurement of the Data Communications Service.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent results from two ice cores drilled in central Greenland have revealed large, abrupt climate changes of at least regional extent during the late stages of the last glaciation, suggesting that climate in the North Atlantic region is able to reorganize itself rapidly, perhaps even within a few decades. Here we present a detailed stable-isotope record for the full length of the Greenland Ice-core Project Summit ice core, extending over the past 250 kyr according to a calculated timescale. We find that climate instability was not confined to the last glaciation, but appears also to have been marked during the last interglacial (as explored more fully in a companion paper) and during the previous Saale–Holstein glacial cycle. This is in contrast with the extreme stability of the Holocene, suggesting that recent climate stability may be the exception rather than the rule. The last interglacial seems to have lasted longer than is implied by the deep-sea SPECMAP record, in agreement with other land-based observations. We suggest that climate instability in the early part of the last interglacial may have delayed the melting of the Saalean ice sheets in America and Eurasia, perhaps accounting for this discrepancy},

  Abstract                 = {Most domestic energy use, most of the time, is invisible to the user. Most people
have only a vague idea of how much energy they are using for different purposes
and what sort of difference they could make by changing day-to-day behaviour or
investing in efficiency measures. Hence the importance of feedback in making
energy more visible and more amenable to understanding and control. This
review considers what is known about the effectiveness of feedback to
householders. The focus is on how people change their behaviour, not on the
detail of the technology used.
There is considerable variety in the feedback literature, but common themes
emerge. The first studies, in the 1970s, established that feedback (mostly via
display monitors) has measurable effects and was worth pursuing, on its own or
in combination with other processes. Feedback came to be seen in terms of a
learning tool, allowing energy users to teach themselves through
experimentation. Overall, the literature demonstrates that clear feedback is a
necessary element in learning how to control fuel use more effectively over a long
period of time and that instantaneous direct feedback in combination with
frequent, accurate billing (a form of indirect feedback) is needed as a basis for
sustained demand reduction. Thus feedback is useful on its own, as a self-
teaching tool. It is also clear that it improves the effectiveness of other
information and advice in achieving better understanding and control of energy
use.},

Britain. It includes information on the number of smart meters that have been
installed in domestic properties and smaller non-domestic sites in the last quarter
and the total number of meters in operation as of 30 June 2015 by the nine larger
energy suppliers.

The Smart Metering Programme is currently in Foundation Stage, which began in
March 2011. The Government is working with the energy industry, consumer groups
and other stakeholders to put commercial and regulatory frameworks in place to
support smart metering, trial and test systems, learn lessons from early installations
and enhance the consumer experience. Most householders will then have smart
meters installed by their energy company in the period between 2016 and 2020.
Further information can be found on the GOV.UK website.

Energy suppliers are currently installing and operating smart meters, smart-type
meters and traditional meters in domestic properties and smart meters, advanced
meters and traditional meters in smaller non-domestic sites (an explanation of
differences between meter types can be found in Section 1.2 of the Introduction).

Key Points

* 272,600 smart meters (160,500 electricity meters and 112,100 gas meters)
were installed in domestic properties in quarter two 2015 (Figure 1 and Table 1), a 29 per cent increase on the number of meters installed during quarter one
2015. An estimated total of 1,327,400 domestic smart meters have been installed
up to 30 June 2015 by the larger energy suppliers.

* 1,193,200 smart meters are now operating in ‘smart mode’ in domestic
properties across Great Britain (Table 2). This represents an increase of 249,700
since the end of quarter one 2015 and 2.5 per cent of all domestic meters
operated by the larger energy suppliers (Figure 2).

* 2,300 smart meters (which includes 100 gas meters) and 16,400 advanced
meters (12,100 electricity meters and 4,300 gas meters) were installed in smaller
non-domestic sites in quarter two 2015 (Figure 3 and Table 3). An estimated total
of 621,400 smart and advanced meters have been installed to 30 June 2015 in
smaller non-domestic sites by the larger energy suppliers.

* 538,400 smart and advanced meters are now operating in smaller nondomestic
sites across Great Britain (Table 4). This represents 19.8 per cent of all
smaller non-domestic site meters operated by the larger energy suppliers
(Figure 4).},

Member States shall ensure the implementation of Smart Grids, not only to meet the Carbon
emissions and renewable targets, but also to meet the energy efficiency target in which customers
will participate actively reversing the overall production to supply value chain.
To meet the objectives of aligning regulatory requirements with Smart Grids projects
implementation by 2020 without barriers, a Smart Grids Task Force has been established in
November 2009 to advise the Commission on policy and regulatory directions at European level
and to coordinate the first steps towards the implementation of Smart Grids under the provision of
the Third Energy Package.
DIGITALEUROPE is one of 25 European Associations representing all European Stakeholders
that are assumed to play a role in the implementation of Smart Grids.
DIGITALEUROPE has decided to participate actively in the Smart Grids Task Force through the
participation in the 3 working groups that have been setup, the Steering Committee and the issue
of the present position paper representing the position of DIGITALEUROPE members.
We believe that Grids cannot become Smart Grids without the paradigm shift to the new era of
Energy Information Management. We believe that other manufacturing and Services sectors have
been able to modernize themselves and become more consumers oriented when they became
digitalized. DIGITALEUROPE believes in the equation of Smart is Digital and Digital is measuring, predicting and monitoring in real time the Energy we want to save and use as a precious resource, not anymore a commodity.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy disaggregation, also known as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), is the task of separating aggregate energy data for a whole building into the energy data for individual appliances. Studies have shown that simply providing disaggregated data to the consumer improves energy consumption behavior. However, placing individual sensors on every device in a home is not presently a practical solution. Disaggregation provides a feasible method for providing energy usage behavior data to the consumer which utilizes currently existing infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel framework to perform the energy disaggregation task. We model each individual device as a single-input, single-output system, where the output is the power consumed by the device and the input is the device usage. In this framework, the task of disaggregation translates into finding inputs for each device that generates our observed power consumption. We describe an implementation of this framework, and show its results on simulated data as well as data from a small-scale experiment.},

We show that the detection performance of the evolutionary algorithm can be improved if the single population approach of the evolutionary algorithm is replaced by a parallel population approach with individual exchange and by the introduction of application-oriented pre-processing and mutation methods.

Such a model captures the whole-image context around the objects but cannot handle multiple instances of the same object in the image without naively replicating the number of outputs for each instance. In this work, we propose a saliency-inspired neural network model for detection, which predicts a set of class-agnostic bounding boxes along with a single score for each box, corresponding to its likelihood of containing any object of interest. The model naturally handles a variable number of instances for each class and allows for cross-class generalization at the highest levels of the network. We are able to obtain competitive recognition performance on VOC2007 and ILSVRC2012, while using only the top few predicted locations in each image and a small number of neural network evaluations.},

  Abstract                 = {Brussels, 17th February 2012 – Citizens and business often waste energy because they do not realise which appliances and lighting use the most energy. An EU-funded project tested in the United Kingdom and Bulgaria is helping to change that – showing consumers reduced energy usage by an average of 8% when provided with an "information dashboard" about their energy use.

The Digital Environment Home Energy Management System (DEHEMS) project shows that when a consumer receives more information about their energy use, and can share and compare this with neighbours and family, they are more likely to change their behaviour. The EU-funded system presents data every 6 seconds through a small digital display. The data can also be displayed in real time via a TV screen, mobile phone, PC or social media app.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes said: "People make better choices when they have better information at hand. The DEHEMS project shows that very simple technologies can go a long way to helping Europe reduce energy use."

The DEHEMS system could set a huge trend in the coming years. Two commercial products are now available: The "Energyhive" (www.energyhive.co.uk) and its network that enables members to get a real time view of their home energy consumption 24/7 through a web browser and "Greenica" (www.greenica.net) which offers special products for homes, schools and small businesses. Thanks to a partnership between Hildebrand and IBM, the DEHEMS project and its lessons will soon be used by businesses both in Europe and worldwide. Major deployment is foreseen with Smart Grids Australia (involving 50,000 homes) and a district heating initiative in Camden, London. Last but not least, the Family House Association in Birmingham is looking to use DEHEMS-type technology thanks to the results achieved so far.},

For instance, the difference between monitored and estimated contribution is, for the month of October 1996, as follows: (i) 13 kW h or $0.85 for the DHW heater and (ii) 6 kW h or $0.36 for the refrigerator. The overall difference for both appliances does not exceed $1.25 for the month of October, for a total electricity bill of 912 kW h and $60.60, which appears to be acceptable for every homeowner. The errors in evaluating the daily energy consumption is between −10.5% and 15.9% for both the DWH heater and the refrigerator.},

The class of models assumes independence between the posterior distribution of the parameters associated with segments of data between successive changepoints. This approach is based on the use of recursions, and is related to work on product partition models. The computational complexity of the approach is quadratic in the number of observations, but an approximate version, which introduces negligible error, and whose computational cost is roughly linear in the number of observations, is also possible. Our approach can be useful, for example within an MCMC algorithm, even when the independence assumptions do not hold. We demonstrate our approach on coal-mining disaster data and on well-log data. Our method can cope with a range of models, and exact simulation from the posterior distribution is possible in a matter of minutes.},

The most well-known examples are energy monitoring, health care applications, in-home activity modeling, and home automation. Real-time energy-use analysis for whole-home approaches needs to understand where and when the electrical loads are spent. Studies have shown that individual loads can be detected (and disaggregated) from sampling the power at one single point (e.g. the electric service entrance for the house) using a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) approach. In this paper, we focus on the feature extraction and pattern recognition tasks for non-intrusive residential electrical consumption traces. In particular, we develop an algorithm capable of determining the step-changes in signals that occur whenever a device is turned on or off, and which allows for the definition of a unique signature (ID) for each device. This algorithm makes use of features extracted from active and reactive powers and power factor. The classification task is carried out by Support Vector Machines and 5-Nearest Neighbors methods. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed signature for distinguishing the different loads.},

  Abstract                 = {Improving energy efficiency by monitoring household electrical consumption is of significant importance with the present-day climate change concerns. A solution for the electrical consumption management problem is the use of a non-intrusive load monitoring system (NILM). This system captures the signals from the aggregate consumption, extracts the features from these signals and classifies the extracted features in order to identify the switched on appliances. An effective device identification (ID) requires a signature to be assigned for each appliance. Moreover, to specify an ID for each device, signal processing techniques are needed for extracting the relevant features. This paper describes a technique for the steady-states recognition in an electrical digital signal as the first stage for the implementation of an innovative NILM. Furthermore, the final goal is to develop an intelligent system for the identification of the appliances by automated learning. The proposed approach is based on the ratio value between rectangular areas defined by the signal samples. The computational experiments show the method effectiveness for the accurate steady-states identification in the electrical input signals.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis presents the development of techniques which enable appliance recognition
in an Advanced Electricity Meter (AEM) to aid individuals reduce their domestic
electricity consumption. The key aspect is to provide immediate and disaggregated
information, down to appliance level, from a single point of measurement.

Three sets of features including the short term time domain, time dependent finite
state machine behaviour and time of day are identified by monitoring step changes in
the power consumption of the home. Associated with each feature set is a membership
which depicts the amount to which that feature set is representative of a particular
appliance. These memberships are combined in a novel framework to effectively
identify individual appliance state changes and hence appliance energy consumption.

An innovative mechanism is developed for generating short term time domain memberships.
Hierarchical and nearest neighbour clustering is used to train the AEM
by generating appliance prototypes which contain an indication of typical parameters.
From these prototypes probabilistic fuzzy memberships and possibilistic fuzzy
typicalities are calculated for new data points which correspond to appliance state
changes. These values are combined in a weighted geometric mean to produce novel
memberships which are determined to be appropriate for the domestic model.

A voltage independent feature space in the short term time domain is developed
based on a model of the appliance’s electrical interface. The components within that
interface are calculated and these, along with an indication of the appropriate model,
form a novel feature set which is used to represent appliances.

The techniques developed are verified with real data and are 99.8% accurate in a
laboratory based classification in the short term time domain. The work presented
in this thesis demonstrates the ability of the AEM to accurately track the energy
consumption of individual appliances.},

The aim of this study was to replace the human observer, needed to score and analyze the behavior of animals, by a fully automated method. For this purpose, in a first step from a video recording of each rat, an activity profile was calculated, from which subsequently a set of meaningful properties was extracted. This set was finally used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Furthermore, specialized kernel functions, namely the so-called time resolved p-spectrum and modified optimal assignment kernels, were developed to calculate the similarity of activity profiles. Our method allows for a very reliable discrimination of animals treated with antidepressants of different classes (tricyclics imipramine and desipramine as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SSRI, fluoxetine) versus a vehicle-treated group. Moreover, our technique is able to classify between tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs. The results of this work enabled the development of an automated and highly accurate behavior classification system.},

  Abstract                 = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a simple and effective framework for modelling time-varying spectral vector sequences. As a consequence, almost all present day large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems are based on HMMs. Whereas the basic principles underlying HMM-based LVCSR are rather straightforward, the approximations and simplifying assumptions involved in a direct implementation of these principles would result in a system which has poor accuracy and unacceptable sensitivity to changes in operating environment. Thus, the practical application of HMMs in modern systems involves considerable sophistication. The aim of this review is first to present the core architecture of a HMM-based LVCSR system and then describe the various refinements which are needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These refinements include feature projection, improved covariance modelling, discriminative parameter estimation, adaptation and normalisation, noise compensation and multi-pass system combination. The review concludes with a case study of LVCSR for Broadcast News and Conversation transcription in order to illustrate the techniques described.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines the recent development of unconventional gas sources and specifically how
they will affect gas markets in China, India, and Australia.
Main Argument
Unconventional gas—comprised of coal bed methane (CBM), tight gas, and shale gas—will
likely play a more important role in nations’ supplies by 2020. China, India, and Australia are the
most likely nations in the Asia-Pacific to follow the United States’ example of changing liquefied
natural gas (LNG) supplies by exploiting unconventional reserves. China, already a large
producer of tight gas, will likely not see greater production in shale and CBM for several more
years. India also has potential for CBM extraction due to plentiful coal reserves, but coal blocks
allocated for CBM development a decade ago have not produced tangible supplies. Australia, however, has planned projects in all three categories of unconventional gas, which accounts for
45% of Australia’s announced LNG export capacity. Though technical, logistic, economic, environmental, and commercial challenges will likely prevent all planned Australian projects
from being completed by 2020, the potential for greater Australian LNG exports through
unconventional gas is evident.
Policy Implications
Though extraction efforts are in their nascent stage, India and China could become more
self-sufficient in the natural gas market if they pursued unconventional gas sources in as
aggressive a manner as Australia.
U.S. technological advances in shale gas extraction could serve as a model for increased
shale gas extraction in Asian nations.
While Australia is a leading producer and exporter of unconventional gas and stands to
greatly increase its exports over the next decade, the country is unlikely to maximize its
potential unless high cost and logistical complexities for planned ventures are remedied.
There is great potential for LNG oversupply in Asia, which could result in lower prices to
stimulate greater demand, delays in the start of projects, lower utilization rates in supply
projects, or the export of LNG outside traditional consumption centers.},

  Abstract                 = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be one of the most widely used tools for learning probabilistic models of time series data. In an HMM, information about the past is conveyed through a single discrete variableâthe hidden state. We discuss a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations, and relate it to the forwardâbackward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods. Within the variational framework, we present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for learning the parameters of the model. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that factorial HMMs can capture statistical structure in this data set which an unconstrained HMM cannot.},

The system is based on a combination of the deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network architecture and the Connectionist Temporal Classification objective function. A modification to the objective function is introduced that trains the network to minimise the expectation of an arbitrary transcription loss function. This allows a direct optimisation of the word error rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or language model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3% on the Wall Street Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9% with only a lexicon of allowed words, and 8.2% with a trigram language model. Combining the network with a baseline system further reduces the error rate to 6.7%.},

However, the results in that work relied on recurrent-neural-network-specific objective functions, which are difficult to integrate with existing large vocabulary speech recognition systems. This paper investigates the use of DBLSTM as an acoustic model in a standard neural network-HMM hybrid system. We find that a DBLSTM-HMM hybrid gives equally good results on TIMIT as the previous work. It also outperforms both GMM and deep network benchmarks on a subset of the Wall Street Journal corpus. However the improvement in word error rate over the deep network is modest, despite a great increase in framelevel accuracy. We conclude that the hybrid approach with DBLSTM appears to be well suited for tasks where acoustic modelling predominates. Further investigation needs to be conducted to understand how to better leverage the improvements in frame-level accuracy towards better word error rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Recognizing lines of unconstrained handwritten text is a challenging task. The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7 percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance.},

These power supplies continuously generate high frequency electromagnetic interference (EMI) during operation that propagates throughout a home's power wiring. We show both analytically and by in-home experimentation that EMI signals are stable and predictable based on the device's switching frequency characteristics. Unlike past transient noise-based solutions, this new approach provides the ability for EMI signatures to be applicable across homes while still being able to differentiate between similar devices in a home. We have evaluated our solution in seven homes, including one six-month deployment. Our results show that ElectriSense can identify and classify the usage of individual devices with a mean accuracy of 93.82%.},

Monitoring many different individual loads on customer premises is a costly, complex, and trouble-prone operation. The availability of a single instrument that could plug into the meter socket and measure individual premise loads would greatly simplify and reduce the cost of customer load monitoring. This report provides the test results of such a prototype instrument.

Background

Building upon university-level research, EPRI worked closely with Enetics, Inc. to develop and deliver in 1997 an instrument that could accurately measure individual residential loads from the meter socket. This approach minimizes the disruption to the homeowner and reduces the risk of damage to the instrumentation. Enetics successfully commercialized the instrument for the residential market. Enetics later developed an enhanced version of the instrument for use in commercial buildings with three-phase service. This program conducted beta tests of four Commercial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring System (CNILMS) instruments at three utility host sites.

Objective

To verify that the instrument was able to accurately and repeatedly disaggregate the customer loads from the meter socket; to build a load library of readily recognizable end-use loads; to identify design deficiencies or potential enhancements prior to final development and commercial introduction.

Approach

Four test instruments were installed at host customer sites provided by three utility companies. Data from the four instruments were captured, stored locally, and regularly uploaded to a remote server for diagnosis and evaluation. To verify the accuracy of the test instruments, parallel instrumentation was installed on many of the end-use loads.

Results

The CNILMS instruments were easily and quickly installed in all cases and the instrument proved to be very reliable and accurate for measuring overall load. In several cases, the instrument was able to detect the presence of over twenty individual loads. Serious limitations were identified in the current version, however. The CNILMS units were unable to:

o Identify individual loads if they turned on or off simultaneously.

o Successfully identify and properly calculate the energy consumption of multiple identical loads.

o Combine the individual loads in "multi-state" devices such as refrigerators into one load identifiable as "refrigerator," although the individual constituent loads were often recognizable.

o Correctly calculate the energy consumption of loads with variable thermal characteristics such as refrigerators.

o Identify a load signal and correlate that signal to a named load. A trained technician must manually assign a load name to the loads identified by the instrument.

EPRI Perspective

Each of the participating host utilities and their participating customers believe that there would be a large market for a successful CNILMS instrument in deregulated energy markets. Energy service companies or energy service suppliers would use the device to help customers compare the energy performance of individual buildings or stores; compare the energy performance of equipment against nameplate ratings; identify poorly performing equipment; resolve high-bill complaints; identify new equipment installed in buildings under performance energy contracts; and optimize overall energy use. It appears that the largest market need is for an instrument that can accurately measure the "big three" commercial loads -- HVAC, refrigeration, and lighting.

Traditional methods of measuring end-use loads in such customer premises require the installation of expensive, failure-prone instrumentation. The custom installation of such instrumentation generally means that it cannot be economically moved to another site and that it is therefore difficult to economically collect data from many sites. The CNILMS approach has tremendous appeal because of its low cost, rapid installation, ability to measure many different loads, and high reliability.

Unfortunately, the current state of development of the instrument is inadequate for commercial acceptance, and considerable additional R&D is required to bring the product to a state of commercial readiness. The instrument developer has development programs underway to resolve these outstanding issues.},

The fast component is determined as fast with reference to the sample rate of the power series, which may be a low sample rate e.g. 1 Hz.; The power consumed by the device may be calculated from the determined periods, or a fault in the appliance may be detected by comparing the measured average power and/or determined periods with a known operation of the appliance to determine differences.},

  Abstract                 = {Global surface temperature has increased ≈0.2°C per decade in the past 30 years, similar to the warming rate predicted in the 1980s in initial global climate model simulations with transient greenhouse gas changes. Warming is larger in the Western Equatorial Pacific than in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific over the past century, and we suggest that the increased West–East temperature gradient may have increased the likelihood of strong El Niños, such as those of 1983 and 1998. Comparison of measured sea surface temperatures in the Western Pacific with paleoclimate data suggests that this critical ocean region, and probably the planet as a whole, is approximately as warm now as at the Holocene maximum and within ≈1°C of the maximum temperature of the past million years. We conclude that global warming of more than ≈1°C, relative to 2000, will constitute “dangerous” climate change as judged from likely effects on sea level and extermination of species.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of the Earth's climate has been extensively studied and a strong link between increases in surface temperatures and greenhouse gases has been established. But this relationship is complicated by several feedback processes—most importantly the hydrological cycle—that are not well understood. Changes in the Earth's greenhouse effect can be detected from variations in the spectrum of outgoing longwave radiation, which is a measure of how the Earth cools to space and carries the imprint of the gases that are responsible for the greenhouse effect. Here we analyse the difference between the spectra of the outgoing longwave radiation of the Earth as measured by orbiting spacecraft in 1970 and 1997. We find differences in the spectra that point to long-term changes in atmospheric CH4, CO2 and O3 as well as CFC-11 and CFC-12. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect that is consistent with concerns over radiative forcing of climate.},

  Abstract                 = {A new tool is presented which analyzes the behavior of an operating electrical load in a novel manner: by automatically describing it with a finite-state model of its control structure. A personal-computer-based system is presented which collects samples of real and reactive power consumption over time, and automatically learns the control structure of the load in real time, drawing its finite-state diagram. The system also reports the load`s state at each point in time, the total time spent in each state, and total energy consumption for each of the states. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated with examples in which the multi-state operating structure of consumer appliances and other electrical systems are determined from monitored power measurements. For example, using a sensor placed at the wall plug of a refrigerator, a finite state diagram with on, off, and defrost states is automatically drawn on the computer screen. Plugging in a washing machine or dish- washer instead reveals the fill, rinse, spin, dry or other states, and how they connect with each other in that particular appliance. Statistics of state durations and energy consumption in each state are also reported. These methods can be applied to energy monitoring, fault monitoring, fault analysis, and power quality analysis of electrical machinery and systems. Another application is to extend nonintrusive load monitoring techniques to multi-state appliances. Although only tested on residential loads and consumer appliances so far, the underlying methods should also work on commercial and industrial loads, e.g., HVAC control systems.},

  Abstract                 = {A new channel model and channel inversion algorithm are presented for correcting symbol sequences that have been corrupted by an unknown combination of known fault mechanisms. The algorithm is similar to the Viterbi algorithm in that it is suitable for situations in which the uncorrupted data string is generated by a known finite-state process, but it is more versatile in that it can correct a much broader class of errors. Of particular importance is the fact that the algorithm corrects common context-sensitive errors, such as symbol changes, transpositions, mergers, splits, insertions, and deletions, which may be assigned different probabilities depending on the context of preceeding and subsequent symbols. As many communication channels can be modeled in this way, this algorithm is a significant extension over the Viterbi algorithm and previous decoding techniques. The notion of channel rules is introduced to provide a framework for the user to specify the channel operation. The algorithm is given in both an off-line form and a recursive form suitable for sequentially presented data streams. In most applications, the recursive form has computational complexity only a constant times that of the Viterbi algorithm},

In this pa- per we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hi- erarchical processing on difficult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modelling when trained with sim- ple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales.},

  Abstract                 = {We show how to use "complementary priors" to eliminate the explaining-away effects that make inference difficult in densely connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

  Abstract                 = {A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

The second stage of the model is a flexible, agent-based analytical tool that allows disaggregation of residual consumption into a sum of consumptions by different groups of appliances. This tool can be used for a variety of applications including an optimization of demand-side management and/or a development of a set of desirable patterns for schedules of electricity-related activities in households (within an acceptable range of course) in order to minimize negative effects of high peak demand.},

We review events exhibiting evidence for elevated atmospheric CO2, global warming, and ocean acidification over the past ~300 million years of Earth’s history, some with contemporaneous extinction or evolutionary turnover among marine calcifiers.

  Abstract                 = {The deployment of smart meters has made available high-frequency (minutes as opposed to monthly) measurements of electricity usage at individual households. Converting these measurements to knowledge that can improve energy efficiency in the residential sector is critical to attract further smart grid investments and engage electricity consumers in the path towards reducing global carbon footprint. The goal of the reported research is to use smart meter measurement data to identify heating and cooling usage levels for a home. This is important to cost effectively design consumer energy services such as energy audit and demand response targeted towards improving an individual household's heating usage efficiency. We present a machine learning approach akin to Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) to disaggregate heating usage from measurements of a household's total electricity usage. We use as input 15-minute interval meter data and hourly outdoor temperature measurements. Our approach does not require a manual set-up procedure at each house. The method uses a Hidden Markov Model to capture the dependence of heating usage on outdoor temperature. Compared to existing methods based on linear regression, the proposed method provides details on heating usage patterns and is more flexible to incorporate other system specific information. Preliminary results based on synthetic and real-world usage data demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.},

Yet, the interface design aspect of these systems has largely been ignored. Therefore, the role that interface design plays at the component level in driving actual energy savings from users is unclear. In this paper, we evaluate the impact interface design has on eco-feedback performance by investigating five established design components. We conducted a six week empirical study with 43 participants using a prototype eco-feedback interface. Analysis of usage data affirmed a statistically significant inverse correlation between user engagement (measured as logins) and energy consumption. Utilizing this relationship as a basis for performance, we expanded our analysis to evaluate the five design components. The study revealed statistically significant evidence corroborating that historical comparison and incentives are design components that drive higher engagement and thus reductions in energy consumption. Results for the normative comparison and disaggregation components were inconclusive, while results for the rewards and penalization component suggest that a revision to the penalization aspect of the component may be necessary. This study raises pertinent questions regarding the efficacy of various eco-feedback components in eliciting energy savings.},

  Abstract                 = {Aggregate INDC emissions are far above levels consistent with below
2°C, with around 65% of global emissions covered
INDCs announced by 1 September 2015 lead to global emissions far above the levels
needed by 2025 and 2030 to put the world on track to hold warming below 2°C, or to below
1.5°C, in 2100.
As of 1st September, 29 INDC submissions have been received, reflecting 56 countries
(including the European Union member states), and covering around 65% of global
emissions in 2010 (excluding LULUCF) and 43% of global population. The CAT has directly
assessed 16 of these INDCs covering 64.5% of global emissions in 2010 (excluding LULUCF)
and 41% of global population.
With the INDCs submitted to date, the CAT projects total global emissions are on track to
be 53-57 GtCO2e in 2025 and 55-59 GtCO2e in 2030, far above the least-cost global
pathways consistent with limiting warming below 2°C. Additional reductions in the order of
12-15 GtO2e by 2025 and of 17-21 GtCO2e by 2030 are needed for global emissions to be
consistent with a 2°C pathway.
INDCs are yet to come from 140 countries. The ten highest emitters yet to submit INDCs
are India, Brazil, Iran, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and
Pakistan, together accounting for 18% of global emissions not yet covered by INDCs
(excluding LULUCF).
Aside from the insufficient ambition of the aggregate INDCs, there is a significant gap
between current policies and the INDCs: global emissions under currently implemented
policies are projected to be higher than the already inadequate INDC levels. Some countries
propose INDCs close to the current trajectory giving confidence that they are met (e.g. EU
and China). Others have put forward a target that would be a significant change in trend, but these are not yet supported by any significant existing legislation, e.g. Australia and
Canada, raising questions about the likely implementation. Yet others are showing progress
in policy implementation, continuously moving their future trajectories downwards, but
policies are not yet sufficient to meet their (still inadequate) INDCs (e.g. USA).
The gap between pledges and policies increases through time, highlighting the need for
long-term policy action. This is not to underplay the significance and importance of
governments putting in place policies that will actually reduce their emissions, but for many
governments this is not yet the case.},

  Abstract                 = {Arctic sea ice is a keystone indicator of greenhouse-gas induced global climate change, which is expected to be amplified in the Arctic. Here we directly compare observed variations in arctic sea-ice extent and CO2 since the beginning of the 20th century, identifying a strengthening linkage, such that in recent decades the rate of sea-ice decrease mirrors the increase in CO2, with r ~ –0.95 over the last four decades, thereby indicating that 90 % (r2 ~ 0.90) of the decreasing sea-ice extent is em-pirically “accounted for” by the increasing CO2 in the atmosphere. The author presents an empirical relation between annual sea-ice extent and global atmospheric CO2 concentrations, in which sea-ice reductions are line-arly, inversely proportional to the magnitude of increase of CO2 over the last few decades. This approximates sea-ice changes during the most recent four decades, with a proportionality constant of 0.030 million km2 per ppmv CO2. When applied to future emission scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), this relationship results in substantially faster ice decreases up to 2050 than predicted by IPCC models. However, depar-tures from this projection may arise from non-linear feedback effects and/or temporary natural variations on interannual timescales, such as the record minimum of sea-ice extent observed in September 2007.},

  Abstract                 = {There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the ubiquitous Hidden Markov Model for learning from sequential and time-series data. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi-Markov modeling, which has been developed mainly in the parametric non-Bayesian setting, to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations.

In this paper we introduce the explicit-duration Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden semi-Markov Model (HDP-HSMM) and develop sampling algorithms for efficient posterior inference. The methods we introduce also provide new methods for sampling inference in the finite Bayesian HSMM. Our modular Gibbs sampling methods can be embedded in samplers for larger hierarchical Bayesian models, adding semi-Markov chain modeling as another tool in the Bayesian inference toolbox. We demonstrate the utility of the HDP-HSMM and our inference methods on both synthetic and real experiments.},

It is demonstrated that either a three-state ESHMM or a standard HMM with an increased number of states is capable of closely matching both Gamma distributions and duration distributions of phonemes from the TIMIT corpus, as measured by Bhattacharyya distance to the true distributions. Standard HMMs are easily implemented with off-the-shelf tools, whereas duration models require substantial algorithmic development and have higher computational costs when implemented, suggesting that a simple adjustment to HMM topologies is perhaps a more efficient solution to the problem of duration than more complex approaches.},

By exploiting this structure in learning, robots can obtain state representations consistent with the aspects of physics relevant to the learning task. We name this prior knowledge about the structure of interactions with the physical world robotic priors. We identify five robotic priors and explain how they can be used to learn pertinent state representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in simulated and real robotic experiments with distracting moving objects. We show that our method extracts task-relevant state representations from high-dimensional observations, even in the presence of task-irrelevant distractions. We also show that the state representations learned by our method greatly improve generalization in reinforcement learning.},

In addition to these variables, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption, as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19 and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level, home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption.},

  Abstract                 = {Wise management of electricity consumption is becoming increasingly important. Domestic electricity
prices in the UK increased by 35% over the past 8 years; an upward trend which is unlikely
to reverse any time soon. As well as the economic costs, the environmental problems associated
with the combustion of fossil fuels are becoming increasingly detrimental to the well-being of many
species, including our own.
One of the cheapest and easiest ways to improve energy eciency is to monitor one's electricity
consumption using a type of smart meter called a \home energy monitor" available for around £40.
These display whole-house consumption in real-time, allowing the user to learn which devices and
behaviours consume the most energy. Studies have demonstrated that the feedback provided by
energy monitors can enable users to reduce consumption by 5-15 %. If every domestic user in the
UK reduced electricity consumption by 10% then the UK's annual CO2 output would be reduced
by 6 million tonnes. However, the information displayed by home energy monitors is not as useful
as it could be.
Home energy monitors measure aggregate consumption for an entire building. Research has
demonstrated that disaggregated information describing appliance-by-appliance energy consumption
is more eective than aggregate information. Disaggregation was rst successfully implemented
in the 1980s using sophisticated smart meters which provide rich, multi-dimensional raw sensor
data. However, these sophisticated meters are not readily available at present.
The main contribution of this project is to design, implement and evaluate three dierent algorithms
for disaggregating the sparse, one-dimensional data output by inexpensive, popular and
readily available home energy monitors. Each design is trained to recognise a device on the basis
of one or more raw recordings of single-device power consumption (which we call signatures). The
system is then given an unseen aggregate signal from which it must infer the start times, run
duration and energy consumption of each device activation present in the aggregate data.
The rst design is a simple prototype which uses a least mean squares approach to matching
a signature to an aggregate signal. As expected, this design succeeds only in a very limited set
of contexts but the development of this prototype provided valuable insights. The second design
represents a novel approach to determining a set of device power states by identifying peaks in the
histogram of the device's signature but this design proved to not be ideal.
The nal design presented in this dissertation represents a novel approach to disaggregation
whereby each device is modelled as a power state graph. Each graph vertex (node) represents a
power state and each edge represents the conditions necessary to transition from the source to the
destination power state. During disaggregation, every possible \t" of the power state graph to
the aggregate data is represented as a tree structure where each tree vertex represents a power
state and each tree edge represents the likelihood for the corresponding power state transition. For
each complete \t" of the power state graph to the aggregate data, the disaggregation algorithm
reports the start time, the average likelihood, the estimated run time and the estimated total energy
consumption. This design has several attractive features: 1) it handles both simple devices and
complex devices whose signatures contain power state sequences which repeat an arbitrary number
of times; 2) it is probabilistic; 3) a power state graph can be learnt from one or more signatures
and 4) the design estimates the energy consumed by each device activation.
This design was evaluated by training it to recognise four real devices: a toaster, a kettle, a
washing machine and a tumble drier. The system was then given 13 days of real aggregate data.
For all devices except the tumble drier it detected every device activation in the aggregate data
although there were a few false positives. The system failed to model the tumble drier, possibly
because the drier has very rapid state transitions.},

Energy disaggregation researchers require datasets of the power demand from individual appliances and the whole-home power demand. Multiple such datasets have been released over the last few years but provide metadata in a disparate array of formats including CSV files and plain-text README files. At best, the lack of a standard metadata schema makes it unnecessarily time-consuming to write software to process multiple datasets and, at worse, the lack of a standard means that crucial information is simply absent from some datasets. We propose a metadata schema for representing appliances, meters, buildings, datasets, prior knowledge about appliances and appliance models. The schema is relational and provides a simple but powerful inheritance mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy disaggregation estimates appliance-by-appliance electricity consumption from a single meter that measures the whole home's electricity demand. Recently, deep neural networks have driven remarkable improvements in classification performance in neighbouring machine learning fields such as image classification and automatic speech recognition. In this paper, we adapt three deep neural network architectures to energy disaggregation: 1) a form of recurrent neural network called `long short-term memory' (LSTM); 2) denoising autoencoders; and 3) a network which regresses the start time, end time and average power demand of each appliance activation. We use seven metrics to test the performance of these algorithms on real aggregate power data from five appliances. Tests are performed against a house not seen during training and against houses seen during training. We find that all three neural nets achieve better F1 scores (averaged over all five appliances) than either combinatorial optimisation or factorial hidden Markov models and that our neural net algorithms generalise well to an unseen house.},

However, research into consumer behaviour suggests that consumers are best able to improve their energy efficiency when provided with itemised, appliance-by-appliance consumption information. Energy disaggregation is a computational technique for estimating appliance-by-appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal. To conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the ‘ground truth’ demand of individual appliances. In this context, we present UK-DALE: an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity at a sample rate of 16 kHz for the whole-house and at 1/6 Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from five houses, one of which was recorded for 655 days, the longest duration we are aware of for any energy dataset at this sample rate. We also describe the low-cost, open-source, wireless system we built for collecting our dataset.},

We analyze their measurements of monthly consumption, changes through time, comparison of appliances, and length of payback period. Because of systematic errors in quantification, consumers choose ineffective energy conservation actions, and underestimate the benefits of previous actions. These errors do not result solely from lack of information since they are made even by consumers who understand technical energymeasurement. To explain the persistence of a seemingly disadvantageous system, we show that consumer methods are cognitively efficient. They are easy to learn and use and are compatible with general-purpose budgeting tasks. However, they lead to higher energy use than would be economically optimal for either the individual or the nation.},

Our focus is on applications where the number of changepoints will increase as we collect more data: for example in genetics as we analyse larger regions of the genome, or in finance as we observe time-series over longer periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimising a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalised likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favourably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies we show that our new method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative exact methods. We also compare with the Binary Segmentation algorithm for identifying changepoints, showing that the exactness of our approach can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the data.},

In contrast with the majority of the existing approaches to solve this problem which require training, here we explore an unsupervised approach to determine the number of appliances in the household, their power consumption and state, at any given moment. We attempt to achieve this without using any a priori information on the number and type of appliances. Our approach is to first create clusters of steady-state changes and then employ a matching pursuit algorithm to reconstruct the original power signals using the clusters that were found as the sources in a linear blind source separation strategy. Changes in steady-state, sometimes referred to as events, are characterized by their change in real and reactive power (P and Q). Ultimately, the results may be applied to other features in an attempt to improve the separation between clusters. The preliminary results point toward a mixed scenario: large appliances (roughly above 400W) were easily identified, but the small appliances typically clustered together and were difficult to separate. We conclude that the errors occur during clustering which indicates that, in order to increase the purity of the clusters, perhaps other features could be used.},

Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

  Abstract                 = {Inspired by recent advances in multimodal learning and machine translation, we introduce an encoder-decoder pipeline that learns (a): a multimodal joint embedding space with images and text and (b): a novel language model for decoding distributed representations from our space. Our pipeline effectively unifies joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch. Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* - "blue" + "red" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800 images are made available for comparison.},

An automatic heating system may, for example, use occupancy data to regulate the indoor temperature.

In this paper, we derive occupancy information from electric load curves measured by off-the-shelf smart electricity meters. Using the publicly available ECO dataset, we show that supervised machine learning algorithms can extract occupancy information with an accuracy between 83% and 94%. To this end we use a comprehensive feature set containing 35 features. Thereby we found that the inclusion of features that capture changes in the activation state of appliances provides the best occupancy detection accuracy.},

In this paper we describe one way to achieve this with very low effort. Furthermore we define several numbers for judging on the quality of NILM algorithms allowing for an easier comparison.

  Abstract                 = {Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason—to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. 

Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.},

Studies have shown that having device-level energy information can cause users to conserve significant amounts of energy, but current electricity meters only report whole-home data. Thus, developing algorithmic methods for disaggregation presents a key technical challenge in the effort to maximize energy conservation. In this paper, we examine a large scale energy disaggregation task, and apply a novel extension of sparse coding to this problem. In particular, we develop a method, based upon structured prediction, for discriminatively training sparse coding algorithms specifically to maximize disaggregation performance. We show that this significantly improves the performance of sparse coding algorithms on the energy task and illustrate how these disaggregation results can provide useful information about energy usage.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers additive factorial hidden Markov models, an extension to HMMs where the state factors into multiple independent chains, and the output is an additive function of all the hidden states. Although such models are very powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly susceptible to local optima. In this paper we propose an alternative inference method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a "robust" mixture component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time. Combining these elements we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing approaches in practice. The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate signal.},

  Abstract                 = {Sequence prediction and classification are ubiquitous and challenging problems in machine learning that can require identifying complex dependencies between temporally distant inputs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have the ability, in theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the short-term memory implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections. However, in practice they are difficult to train successfully when the long-term memory is required. This paper introduces a simple, yet powerful modification to the standard RNN architecture, the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations only at its prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more complex, CW-RNN reduces the number of RNN parameters, improves the performance significantly in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The network is demonstrated in preliminary experiments involving two tasks: audio signal generation and TIMIT spoken word classification, where it outperforms both RNN and LSTM networks.},

In this paper, we are able to evolve extremely small recurrent neural network (RNN) controllers for a task that previously required networks with over a million weights. The high-dimensional visual input, which the controller would normally receive, is first transformed into a compact feature vector through a deep, max-pooling convolutional neural network (MPCNN).

Data-mining algorithms capture the relationships among the power output, power factor, and controllable and non-controllable variables of a 1.5Â MW wind turbine. An evolutionary strategy algorithm solves the data-derived optimization model and determines optimal control settings. Computational experience has demonstrated opportunities to improve the power factor and the power output by optimizing set points of blade pitch angle and generator torque. It is shown that the pitch angle and the generator torque can be controlled to maximize the energy capture from the wind and enhance the quality of the power produced by the wind turbine with a DFIG generator. These improvements are in the presence of reactive power remedies used in modern wind turbines. The concepts proposed in this paper are illustrated with the data collected at an industrial wind farm.},

The empirical Bayes approach is also applied to solve long-standing frequentist problems such as significance testing of the null hypothesis of no change-points versus multiple change-point alternatives, and inference on the number and locations of change-points that partition the unknown parameter sequence into segments of equal values. Simulation studies of performance and an illustrative application to the British coal mine data are also given.

Load signatures can be applied to produce many useful services and products, such as, determining the energy usage of individual appliances, monitoring the health of critical equipment, monitoring power quality, and developing facility management tools. Load signatures of typical yet extensive loads are needed to be collected before applying them to different services and products. As there are an enormous number of electrical appliances, it is beneficial to classify the appliances for building a well-organized load signature database. The objective of this study is to develop an effective method to classify the loads. A 2-dimensional form of load signatures, voltage-current (V-l) trajectory, is suggested for characterizing the typical household appliances.Hierarchical clustering method was employed to classify the appliances and construct the taxonomy of the appliances. The taxonomy based on V-l trajectory was compared to the taxonomies based on traditional power metrics and eigenvectors in the previous studies. It was found that the groups of appliances in the taxonomy based on V-I trajectory were well-separated and had engineering meanings .},

This model is inspired by the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which has been shown to be a powerful model of such distributions. However, an RBM typically does not provide a tractable distribution estimator, since evaluating the probability it assigns to some given observation requires the computation of the so-called partition function, which itself is intractable for RBMs of even moderate size. Our model circumvents this difficulty by decomposing the joint distribution of observations into tractable conditional distributions and modeling each conditional using a non-linear function similar to a conditional of an RBM. Our model can also be interpreted as an autoencoder wired such that its output can be used to assign valid probabilities to observations. We show that this new model outperforms other multivariate binary distribution estimators on several datasets and performs similarly to a large (but intractable) RBM.},

It is possible to use modem state and parameter estimation algorithms to verify remotely the "health" of electromechanical loads by using NILM to analyze measured waveforms associated with the operation of individual loads. NILM can also monitor the operation of the electrical distribution system itself, identifying situations where two or more otherwise healthy loads interfere with each other's operation through voltage waveform distortion or power quality problems. Strategies for nonintrusive monitoring have developed over the last 20 years. Advances in computing technology make a new wealth of computational tools useful in practical, field-based NILM systems.

  Abstract                 = {Obtaining high quality information economically and reliably is always a difficult objective to achieve. The electric power industry and consumers recently face many challenges, such as deregulation, autonomous power systems and power quality. The knowledge of the nature and state of the power systems will undoubtedly be the key in meeting these challenges. The Non-Intrusive Power Monitor is a novel attempt to collect such information with a minimal physical installation. Raw voltage and current are measured at a single location to yield harmonic power signals. They typically carry the fingerprints of the electric loads present in a system, and their analysis can produce such information as the operational and diagnostic status of the loads. The power signals can also be used for the system identification, parameter estimation and energy consumption optimization study. In this research, the power signals are mostly modeled as stochastic processes and various detection, estimation and pattern recognition algorithms are developed to extract desired information. A constant load status identifier is developed in this thesis which can identify the ON and OFF status of electric loads, both from their steady-state power consumptions and transient patterns. The identifier can also classify multiple load events occurring at a same time and estimate states without load events. The power consumed by a variable speed drive is also estimated using the correlations between the fundamental powers and higher harmonic powers. The harmonic signal generated by the imbalance of a rotating machine is estimated to monitor the drive, i.e. its speed and magnitude of the imbalance. The algorithms are thoroughly tested using the data collected at real buildings, and some of them are implemented on-line.(cont.) This thesis focuses on developing mathematical models and signal processing algorithms for the customers at the end of the AC distribution system. Its results will directly benefit the developments of a ubiquitous electric meter in a deregulated market, a diagnostic or prognostic tool for mission-critical systems and an intelligent power quality monitor.},

Three random switching simulators are also developed to investigate the performance of different CDMs under a variety of scenarios. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that all CDMs outperform any single-feature, single-algorithm-based disaggregation methods. With sensitivity analysis, we also show that the CDMs are less sensitive to any load dynamics and noise.

  Abstract                 = {The novel feature extraction method for nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) systems was proposed in this paper. In order to monitoring the status of each load, a sensor is installed for each load traditionally. The status of the load is transmitted to the main controller such that the status of each load can be monitored. On the other hand, the NILM is able to detect the status of loads by analyzing the current signals that is picked-up by a current sensor installed at the main electrical panel. Traditional NILM methods used real power, reactive power, harmonic contents of power signatures and transient energy to determine the status of appliances. These methods are very complex and require a lot of computation. In this paper, a novel method that integrates artificial intelligent recognition technique and load current acquisition method for NILM is proposed. The proposed method uses timedomain information. This approach is different from traditional NILM methods. The proposed method is able to detect the energization and de-energization of loads by applying back-propagation neural networks (BP-ANNs). The overall correct rate for this method is above 98.75%. This result shows that the proposed method is able to determine the operation status of loads with proper robustness.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the global warming and climate changes, using and conserving of the electrical energy effectively becomes a very important issue recently. If each appliance operates efficiently, the power energy can be used and conserved effectively. Further, the greenhouse gases can also gradually be reduced. This paper* proposes a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) system that employs a decision mechanism based on hierarchical support vector machines (HSVM) to identify the energizing and de-energizing statuses of each load. In the proposed system, the load energizing and de-energizing transient features are extracted from load current waveforms that are acquired at the power entering point. The HSVM performs load identification tasks based on the features. Although a support vector machine (SVM) identifier can solve nonlinear separable cases and optimize the decision hyper-plane, it is a two-class identifier. On the other hand, the NILM problem is a multi-class identification problem. Since any multi-class identification problem can be decomposed into a series of two-class identification sub-problems, the proposed system applies a group of binary SVMs that are arranged into a form of hierarchical tree to identify the operation status of each load. Each node within the tree represents a binary SVM identifier, and each identifier is assigned to solve a corresponding two-class sub-problem. Through this hierarchical decision process, the class of an undetermined datum can be identified. Finally, the results in different experiment environments show that the proposed system is able to identify the operation status of each load, and it also has appropriate robustness.},

In addition to direct energy sensing methods, e.g. electricity and gas, it is often desirable to monitor energy use and occupant activity through other sensors such as temperature and motion. However, practical constraints such as cost and deployment requirements can limit the choice, quantity and quality of sensors that can be distributed within each building, especially for large-scale deployments. In this paper, we present an approach to select a set of sensors for capturing energy events, using a measure of each candidate sensor's ability to predict energy events within a building. We use constrained optimisation -- specifically, a bounded knapsack problem (BKP) -- to choose the best sensors for the set given each sensor's predictive value and specified cost constraints. We present the results from a field study of 4 UK homes with temperature, light, motion, humidity, sound and CO2 sensors, showing how valuable yet expensive sensors are often not chosen in the optimal set.},

  Abstract                 = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

  Abstract                 = {Changes in past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations can be determined by measuring the composition of air trapped in ice cores from Antarctica. So far, the Antarctic Vostok and EPICA Dome C ice cores have provided a composite record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over the past 650,000 years. Here we present results of the lowest 200 m of the Dome C ice core, extending the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by two complete glacial cycles to 800,000 yr before present. From previously published data and the present work, we find that atmospheric carbon dioxide is strongly correlated with Antarctic temperature throughout eight glacial cycles but with significantly lower concentrations between 650,000 and 750,000 yr before present. Carbon dioxide levels are below 180 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.) for a period of 3,000 yr during Marine Isotope Stage 16, possibly reflecting more pronounced oceanic carbon storage. We report the lowest carbon dioxide concentration measured in an ice core, which extends the pre-industrial range of carbon dioxide concentrations during the late Quaternary by about 10 p.p.m.v. to 172–300 p.p.m.v.},

We present the Almanac of Minutely Power dataset (AMPds) for load disaggregation research; it contains one year of data that includes 11 measurements at one minute intervals for 21 sub-meters. AMPds also includes natural gas and water consumption data. Finally, we use AMPds to present findings from our own load disaggregation algorithm to show that current, rather than real power, is a more effective measure for NILM.},

The two proposed approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique. Here, we describe two approaches for circuit-level NILM that enable detailed, practical household energy monitoring: a heuristic-based approach and a Bayesian approach. Both address the limitations of previous NILM algorithms by considering steady-state power use in addition to step changes in steady-state power use and by using circuit-level energy measurements. Using the historical steady-state energy use pattern for each device lets us more precisely classify each edge and eliminate some cases of indistinguishable step changes. By measuring energy use at the circuit level, we can overcome the inability of whole-house NILM to monitor small or variable-power devices. This is because there are fewer devices on each circuit and high-powered devices (such as a stove, hot-water heater, air conditioner, and clothes dryer) each receive dedicated circuits and won't overshadow lower-powered devices (such as LVs, radios, and cell phone chargers).},

  Abstract                 = {The first requirement for any intelligent household energy management system is to be able to accurately measure energy usage in the home. Measuring energy usage is not difficult, however we must decide what to measure. Whole-home energy measurement is cheap and easy to setup because only one sensor is placed where the home connects to the power grid. The collected data can provide useful information for large appliances. However, the only way to monitor the energy usage of smaller devices is to install an energy meter on every device of interest. This creates a very detailed picture of household energy consumption, but requires a lot of additional hardware---one meter per device in the home. This paper explores an alternative, more practical, approach to monitor household energy usage including small devices. Our approach uses circuit-level power measurements and a new method to separate aggregate data into device-level estimates. Our initial evaluation resulted in an average error less than 5:35% for three devices with good response to changing device state. We therefore believe that this approach, coupled with a device-level control system, would create an ideal architecture for the next generation of household energy management systems.},

The account presented here suggests that memories are first stored via synaptic changes in the hippocampal system, that these changes support reinstatement of recent memories in the neocortex, that neocortical synapses change a little on each reinstatement, and that remote memory is based on accumulated neocortical changes. Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences. The hippocampal system permits rapid learning of new items without disrupting this structure, and reinstatement of new memories interleaves them with others to integrate them into structured neocortical memory systems.},

However, the provenance and age of the fossils have been much debated5, 6. Here we confirm that the Omo I and Omo II hominid fossils are from similar stratigraphic levels in Member I of the Kibish Formation, despite the view that Omo I is more modern in appearance than Omo II1, 2, 3. 40Ar/39Ar ages on feldspar crystals from pumice clasts within a tuff in Member I below the hominid levels place an older limit of 198 plusminus 14 kyr (weighted mean age 196 plusminus 2 kyr) on the hominids. A younger age limit of 104 plusminus 7 kyr is provided by feldspars from pumice clasts in a Member III tuff. Geological evidence indicates rapid deposition of each member of the Kibish Formation. Isotopic ages on the Kibish Formation correspond to ages of Mediterranean sapropels, which reflect increased flow of the Nile River, and necessarily increased flow of the Omo River. Thus the 40Ar/39Ar age measurements, together with the sapropel correlations, indicate that the hominid fossils have an age close to the older limit. Our preferred estimate of the age of the Kibish hominids is 195 plusminus 5 kyr, making them the earliest well-dated anatomically modern humans yet described.},

  Abstract                 = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

However, very often change point analysis is only focused on the changes in the mean value of some quantity in a process. In this work we consider time series with discrete point changes which may contain a finite number of changes of probability density functions (pdf). We focus on the case where the data in all segments are modeled by Gaussian probability density functions with different means, variances and correlation lengths. We put a prior law on the change point occurances (Poisson process) as well as on these different parameters (conjugate priors) and give the expression of the posterior probability distributions of these change points. The computations are done by using an appropriate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique.

The problem as we stated can also be considered as an unsupervised classification and/or segmentation of the time serie. This analogy gives us the possibility to propose alternative modeling and computation of change points.},

  Abstract                 = {The introduction of electricity monitors (in-home displays; IHDs), which show accurate and up-to-the-minute energy usage, is expected to lead to reduction in consumption. Studies of feedback on domestic electricity use have generally supported this view. However, such studies also demonstrate wide variation between households. Examining the heterogeneity of responses is essential for understanding the actual and potential effectiveness of IHDs and in order to target interventions effectively. To explore differences between households' responses to IHDs, we conducted a qualitative study with 21 households who had an IHD for more than six months. Of the 21, only four households continued to refer to the IHD and the findings suggest that attempts to reduce energy consumption were situated in wider social and physical contexts. Further, the participants demonstrated energy saving behaviour before and outside of IHD usage. The patterns of energy behaviours and attempts at electricity conservation could best be understood by categorising the households into three types: the Monitor Enthusiasts (20%), the Aspiring Energy Savers (60%) and the Energy Non-Engaged (20%). The factors of importance in energy behaviour differed between the categories. Financial savings contributed to efforts to reduce energy use but only up to boundaries which varied considerably between households. Social practices and social relationships appeared to constrain what actions households were prepared to undertake, illuminating aspects of inter-household variation. Within the household, all energy users were not equal and we found that women were particularly influential on energy use through their primary responsibility for domestic labour on behalf of the household. The implications of the findings for environmental campaigning are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {DTAM is a system for real-time camera tracking and reconstruction which relies not on feature extraction but dense, every pixel methods. As a single hand-held RGB camera flies over a static scene, we estimate detailed textured depth maps at selected keyframes to produce a surface patchwork with millions of vertices. We use the hundreds of images available in a video stream to improve the quality of a simple photometric data term, and minimise a global spatially regularised energy functional in a novel non-convex optimisation framework. Interleaved, we track the camera's 6DOF motion precisely by frame-rate whole image alignment against the entire dense model. Our algorithms are highly parallelisable throughout and DTAM achieves real-time performance using current commodity GPU hardware. We demonstrate that a dense model permits superior tracking performance under rapid motion compared to a state of the art method using features; and also show the additional usefulness of the dense model for real-time scene interaction in a physics-enhanced augmented reality application.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of analyzing a time series database is to find whether and how frequent a periodic pattern is repeated within the series. Periodic pattern mining is the problem that regards temporal regularity. However, most of the existing algorithms have a major limitation in mining interesting patterns of users interest, that is, they can mine patterns of specific length with all the events sequentially one after another in exact positions within this pattern. Though there are certain scenarios where a pattern can be flexible, that is, it may be interesting and can be mined by neglecting any number of unimportant events in between important events with variable length of the pattern. Moreover, existing algorithms can detect only specific type of periodicity in various time series databases and require the interaction from user to determine periodicity. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm for the periodic pattern mining in time series databases which does not rely on the user for the period value or period type of the pattern and can detect all types of periodic patterns at the same time, indeed these flexibilities are missing in existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm facilitates the user to generate different kinds of patterns by skipping intermediate events in a time series database and find out the periodicity of the patterns within the database. It is an improvement over the generating pattern using suffix tree, because suffix tree based algorithms have weakness in this particular area of pattern generation. Comparing with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves generating different kinds of interesting patterns and detects whether the generated pattern is periodic or not. We have tested the performance of our algorithm on both synthetic and real life data from different domains and found a large number of interesting event sequences which were missing in existing algorithms and the proposed algorithm was efficient enough in generating and detecting periodicity of flexible patterns on both types of data.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a low-cost approach to obtain and analyze electrical power data that
are very useful for performance monitoring and fault detection.
Goals:
• Reduce the energy consumption and associated environmental degradation of
commercial buildings in California, the U.S. and throughout the world;
• Reduce energy costs.
How to meet these goals?
• Deployment of appropriate methods for monitoring building performance and
automatically detecting and diagnosing faults in energy-consuming equipment or in
building components that directly affect energy usage.
Measurements are valuable but often expensive:
• Can't control what cannot be measured;
• Component-specific data brings into sharp focus variations in whole-building energy
consumption patterns that may hint at operating problems and energy waste;
• Building owner and operators are naturally reluctant to invest in more sensors.
One way to move forward is to make as much use as possible from electricityconsumption
data:
• Electricity-consumption data can be directly related to operating costs through
electricity rates or bilateral purchase contracts;
• Detailed measurements can help detect and diagnose excessive whole-building energy
usage and component-level faults.
How to keep costs down?
Researchers at MIT over the last 15 years have taken significant strides toward
developing a very powerful electricity monitoring approach that can pull component-level
information out of whole-building electrical service, the electricity supplied to a major
building subsystem (HVAC), or other electrical systems (transportation, industry). The
product based on this approach is known as a Non-Intrusive Load Monitor or, more
simply, NILM. More information about the NILM is found in [1-4].
We consider several field applications to illustrate the utility of the NILM},

The paper reviews evaluation methods used internationally for both building thermal efficiency and building energy labelling and presents results from two discrete studies in South Australia on monitoring actual household energy consumption. In order to investigate the occupancy effect on household energy, monitored energy data collected from two different housing developments in South Australia were examined. The energy ratings for these homes are compliant with the national agreed protocols for thermal performance modelling of dwellings, where one set of homes is a group occupied by higher socio-economic groups and the other is low income public housing in a colder climate region with much poorer home energy ratings. The wide variation of actual household energy for the homes that have relatively similar thermal envelopes indicates a lack of meaningful use for actual household energy in disclosure of house energy performance. Therefore, it is argued that thermal modelling software used to rate homes appears a more useful application of a system of disclosure of energy performance than the use of energy bills.},

One of the crucial functions of a brain is to make predictions of what will happen next, or in the near future. This ability helps us to anticipate upcoming events and plan our reactions to them in advance. To make these predictions, past information needs to be stored, transformed or used otherwise. How exactly the brain achieves this information processing is far from clear and under heavy investigation. To guide this extraordinary research effort, neuroscientists increasingly look for theoretical frameworks that could help explain the data recorded from the brain, and to make the enormous task more manageable. This is evident, for instance, through the funding of the billion-dollar ”Human Brain Project”, of the European Union, amongst others. Mathematical techniques from graph and information theory, control theory, dynamical and complex systems (Sporns 2011), statistical mechanics (Rolls and Deco 2010), as well as machine learning and computer vision (Seung 2012; Hawkins and Blakeslee 2004), have provided new insights into brain structure and possible function, and continue to generate new hypotheses for future research.},

study in [139] presents a first evaluation of machine learning techniques to classify
the operating status of electric appliances (with and without inverter) for the
purpose of constructing a non-intrusive monitoring system. In this study, RBF
networks, K-nearest neighbor classifiers (KNNs) (e.g. [42]), SVMs and ν-Arc (cf.
Section 6.2) were compared.
The data set available for this task is rather small (36 examples), since the
collection and labeling of data is manual and therefore expensive. As a result
of this, one has to be very careful with finding good model parameters. All
model parameters were found using the computationally expensive but generally
reliable leave-one-out method.
The results reported in [139] demonstrate that the ν-Arc algorithm with RBF
networks as base learner performs better on average than all other algorithms
studied, followed closely by the SVM classifier with a RBF kernel. These results
suggest that the goal of a control system to balance load peaks might be a
feasible prospect in the not too distant future."},

Experimental evidence suggests that if these trends continue, key marine organisms—such as corals and some plankton—will have difficulty maintaining their external calcium carbonate skeletons. Here we use 13 models of the ocean–carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a 'business-as-usual' scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean. When live pteropods were exposed to our predicted level of undersaturation during a two-day shipboard experiment, their aragonite shells showed notable dissolution. Our findings indicate that conditions detrimental to high-latitude ecosystems could develop within decades, not centuries as suggested previously.},

The paper reviews evaluation methods used internationally for both building thermal efficiency and building energy labelling and presents results from two discrete studies in South Australia on monitoring actual household energy consumption. In order to investigate the occupancy effect on household energy, monitored energy data collected from two different housing developments in South Australia were examined. The energy ratings for these homes are compliant with the national agreed protocols for thermal performance modelling of dwellings, where one set of homes is a group occupied by higher socio-economic groups and the other is low income public housing in a colder climate region with much poorer home energy ratings. The wide variation of actual household energy for the homes that have relatively similar thermal envelopes indicates a lack of meaningful use for actual household energy in disclosure of house energy performance. Therefore, it is argued that thermal modelling software used to rate homes appears a more useful application of a system of disclosure of energy performance than the use of energy bills.},

  Abstract                 = {The Household Electricity Survey (HES) was the most
detailed monitoring of electricity use ever carried
out in the UK. Preliminary findings were published in
2012, and provided unparalleled insights about
energy use in the home. This is a summary of more
thorough analysis of the survey data, structured
around 30 questions drawn up by DECC and DEFRA.
The work was carried out in 2013 and 2014, and
more detailed reports are available here1
.
The opportunity to glean more from this data could
hardly be more timely. We are at a critical juncture
in planning electricity generation, where the UK
must invest £110bn in energy infrastructure2
– partly
to replace the power stations built in the 1960s and
70s, now reaching the end of their useful lives. We
must meet the Government’s target of an 80%
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and
at the same time balance the necessities of
maintaining the country’s fuel security and allocating
resources wisely for the long-term. We cannot make
informed decisions about electricity generation
without also understanding the potential for
efficiencies and savings from households (and other
sectors). This relies on robust data and analysis.
At the same time, the UK Government is committed
to the most complex smart metering and consumer
engagement project in the world – the vision of a
smart grid, where data becomes the prime 
commodity to manage consumption and demand.
The Green Deal is also changing the landscape for
cutting energy use in homes.
In this report we present our answers to four
questions about household electricity use: what it is
used for, when it is used, who uses it, and how this
might change over the next few decades.

Findings
Our findings span five themes, addressing different
aspects of electricity use in homes. First we look at
appliances: what appliances householders own,
what energy labels they have, how old they are, and
when they tend to replace them. Then we examine
how much electricity could be saved in different
ways and how much could be trimmed from the
peak load. Finally we look at the scope for improving
the modelling of electricity use in homes, and social
studies that were carried out under the project.
Appliances
We found enormous variation in the ages of
appliances the HES households owned, with one
fridge-freezer 41 years old. The average appliance
age across all households varied from 3.8 years for
kettles to 8.4 years for fridge-freezers. Only a tiny
proportion of households owned the most efficient
appliance currently available, and for cold
appliances, washing machines, tumble dryers and
dishwashers almost 100% could be replaced with
more efficient models. The most efficient models
available are at least 20% more efficient than the
most commonly owned ones.
Cold appliances and washing machines are also
getting bigger: fridges purchased by HES households
got two-fifths bigger, on average, from 1985 to 2011,
while freezers and fridge-freezers grew by one fifth.
On average, this increase in size is partially offsetting
the efficiency gains made by appliance
manufacturers},

  Abstract                 = {Automated musical accompaniment of human performers often requires an agent be able to follow a musical score with similar facility to that of a human performer. Systems described in the literature represent musical scores in a way that assumes no large-scale structural variation of the piece during performance. If the performer deviates from the expected path by skipping or repeating a section, the system may become lost. We describe a way to automatically generate a Markov model from a written score that models the score form, and an on-line algorithm to align a performance to a score. The resulting system can follow performances that take alternate paths through the score without losing its place. We compare the performance of our system to that of sequence-based score followers on a melodic corpus of 98 Jazz melodies. Results show that explicitly representing the branching structure of a score significantly improves score following when the branch a performer may take is unknown beforehand.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy monitoring and smart grid applications have rapidly developed into a multi-billion dollar market. The continued growth and utility of monitoring technologies is predicated upon the ability to economically extract actionable information from acquired data streams. One of the largest roadblocks to effective analytics arises from the disparities of scale inherent in all aspects of data collection and processing. Managing these multifaceted dynamic range issues is crucial to the success of load monitoring and smart grid technology.

This thesis presents NilmDB, a comprehensive framework for energy monitoring applications. The NilmDB management system is a network-enabled database that supports efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of vast, timestamped data sets. It allows a flexible and powerful separation between on-site, high-bandwidth processing operations and off-site, low-bandwidth control and visualization. Specific analysis can be performed as data is acquired, or retroactively as needed, using short filter scripts written in Python and transferred to the monitor.

The NilmDB framework is used to implement a spectral envelope preprocessor, an integral part of many non-intrusive load monitoring workflows that extracts relevant harmonic information and provides significant data reduction. A robust approach to spectral envelope calculation is presented using a 4-parameter sinusoid fit.

A new physically-windowed sensor architecture for improving the dynamic range of non-intrusive data acquisition is also presented and demonstrated. The hardware architecture utilizes digital techniques and physical cancellation to track a large-scale main signal while maintaining the ability to capture small-scale variations.},

One approach in the domestic sector is to improve consumer understanding of how much energy is consumed by each of their household appliances. This empowers consumers to make educated decisions on how they can change their lifestyle in an effort to reduce their energy consumption. This report investigates how total household energy consumption can be disaggregated into individual appliances using low granularity data collected from a single point of measurement, such as a smart meter. First, this work discusses how this problem can be solved using combinatorial optimisation. Second, a novel approach is introduced using hidden Markov models to model each appliance. We show through empirical evaluation that our implementation of the hidden Markov model approach outperforms the combinatorial optimisation method. Our future work is then outlined to show how we plan to better model domestic appliances and therefore improve the accuracy of our approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), or energy disaggregation, is the process of using signal processing and machine learning to separate the energy consumption of a building into individual appliances. In recent years, a number of data sets have been released in order to evaluate such approaches, which contain both building-level and appliance-level energy data. However, these data sets typically cover less than 10 households due to the financial cost of such deployments, and are not released in a format which allows the data sets to be easily used by energy disaggregation researchers. To this end, the Dataport database was created by Pecan Street Inc, which contains 1 minute circuit-level and building-level electricity data from 722 households. Furthermore, the non-intrusive load monitoring toolkit (NILMTK) was released in 2014, which provides software infrastructure to support energy disaggregation research, such as data set parsers, benchmark disaggregation algorithms and accuracy metrics. This paper describes the release of a subset of the Dataport database in NILMTK format, containing one month of electricity data from 669 households. Through the release of this Dataport data in NILMTK format, we pose a challenge to the signal processing community to produce energy disaggregation algorithms which are both accurate and scalable.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the design, development, and evaluation of an end-user installable, whole house power consumption sensing system capable of gathering accurate real-time power use that does not require installing a current transformer around the electrical feeds in a home. Rather, our sensor system offers contactless operation by simply placing it on the outside of the breaker panel in a home. Although there are a number of existing commercial systems for gathering energy use in a home, almost none can easily and safely be installed by a homeowner (especially for homes in the U.S.). Our approach leverages advances in magnetoresistive materials and circuit design to allow contactless operation by reliably sensing the magnetic field induced by the 60 Hz current and a closed loop circuit allows us to precisely infer the power consumption in real-time. The contribution of this work is an enabling technology for researchers in the fields of Ubiquitous Computing and Human-Computer Interaction wanting to conduct practical large-scale deployments of end-user-deployable energy monitoring applications. We discuss the technical details, the iterative design, and end-user evaluations of our sensing approach.},

Many existing systems for detecting occupant activity require large numbers of sensors, invasive vision systems, or extensive installation procedures. We present an approach that uses a single plug-in sensor to detect a variety of electrical events throughout the home. This sensor detects the electrical noise on residential power lines created by the abrupt switching of electrical devices and the noise created by certain devices while in operation. We use machine learning techniques to recognize electrically noisy events such as turning on or off a particular light switch, a television set, or an electric stove. We tested our system in one home for several weeks and in five homes for one week each to evaluate the system performance over time and in different types of houses. Results indicate that we can learn and classify various electrical events with accuracies ranging from 85-90%.},

The key contributions are (a) a novel 'segmented' application of the Viterbi algorithm for sequence decoding with the HMM, (b) details of establishing observation and state transition probabilities for the HMM, and (c) procedures for careful handling of low power signatures.

Although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Cenozoic era (about 60 Myr ago) are widely believed to have been higher than at present, there is disagreement regarding the exact carbon dioxide levels, the timing of the decline and the mechanisms that are most important for the control of CO2 concentrations over geological timescales. Here we use the boron-isotope ratios of ancient planktonic foraminifer shells to estimate the pH of surface-layer sea water throughout the past 60 million years, which can be used to reconstruct atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We estimate CO2 concentrations of more than 2,000 p.p.m. for the late Palaeocene and earliest Eocene periods (from about 60 to 52 Myr ago), and find an erratic decline between 55 and 40 Myr ago that may have been caused by reduced CO2 outgassing from ocean ridges, volcanoes and metamorphic belts and increased carbon burial. Since the early Miocene (about 24 Myr ago), atmospheric CO2 concentrations appear to have remained below 500 p.p.m. and were more stable than before, although transient intervals of CO2 reduction may have occurred during periods of rapid cooling approximately 15 and 3 Myr ago.},

  Abstract                 = {Arctic sea-ice extent and volume are declining rapidly. Several studies project that the Arctic Ocean may become seasonally ice-free by the year 2040 or even earlier. Putting this into perspective requires information on the history of Arctic sea-ice conditions through the geologic past. This information can be provided by proxy records from the Arctic Ocean floor and from the surrounding coasts. Although existing records are far from complete, they indicate that sea ice became a feature of the Arctic by 47 Ma, following a pronounced decline in atmospheric pCO2 after the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Optimum, and consistently covered at least part of the Arctic Ocean for no less than the last 13–14 million years. Ice was apparently most widespread during the last 2–3 million years, in accordance with Earth's overall cooler climate. Nevertheless, episodes of considerably reduced sea ice or even seasonally ice-free conditions occurred during warmer periods linked to orbital variations. The last low-ice event related to orbital forcing (high insolation) was in the early Holocene, after which the northern high latitudes cooled overall, with some superimposed shorter-term (multidecadal to millennial-scale) and lower-magnitude variability. The current reduction in Arctic ice cover started in the late 19th century, consistent with the rapidly warming climate, and became very pronounced over the last three decades. This ice loss appears to be unmatched over at least the last few thousand years and unexplainable by any of the known natural variabilities. },

  Abstract                 = {Britain’s smart meter upgrade is gathering pace, and those who’ve already
got their smart meter are giving the technology a big thumbs-up.
This report for Smart Energy GB, conducted by independent research
company Populus, has found that 84 per cent of people with smart meters
would recommend one to others.

Smart meters will bring an end to estimated bills and provide accurate
information about what we’re spending in pounds and pence in near real
time. Helping us all to use the amount of energy we want, without worrying
about the shock of an unknown bill.

Smart meters will also open the door to smarter grids and future innovation
with smart appliances and tariffs. The national upgrade represents a vital
digitisation of the energy industry, replacing analogue technology which
creates confusion and inaccuracy – the mechanical meters that haven’t
changed much since the 19th century.

Every home and microbusiness in Great Britain will have the opportunity
to upgrade to a smart meter by 2020. Smart meters will be installed by
energy suppliers, at no extra cost to consumers, and more than 1.6 million
have already been fitted across Scotland, England and Wales.

Smart energy outlook is published twice a year by Smart Energy GB. The
research is a snapshot of the real views and experiences of the British
public: how they feel about their gas and electricity, how those who already
have their smart meters are finding the new technology, and the impact
this transformation of our national infrastructure is having on their lives.

Key findings:
• More than eight in ten (84 per cent) of people with a smart meter
would recommend one to others.
• Nearly eight in ten (79 per cent) of smart meter customers have taken
steps to use less energy such as turning off lights, turning their heating
down or changing the way they use household appliances.
• People with smart meters feel more informed and in control of their
energy use. More than eight in ten (82 per cent) feel they have a better
idea of what they are spending on energy and nearly seven in ten (69
per cent) say they are more conscious about the energy that they use.
• Smart meter customers are also more confident in the accuracy of
their bills. Nearly four in five (79 per cent) believe that their energy bills
are accurate, whereas only 59 per cent of those without a smart meter
feel the same.

Research methodology: Populus conducted 10,101 interviews using a bespoke online survey, designed to be representative of the population in Great Britain. The
interviews took place between 18th May and 1st June 2015.},

The NILM and associated software convert the V/I signal to spectral power envelopes that can be searched to determine when a transient occurs. The identification of this signal can then be determined by an expert classifier and a series of these classifications can be used to diagnose system failures or improper operation. Current NILM research conducted at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems (LEES) is exploring the application and expansion of NILM technology for the use of monitoring shipboard systems. This thesis presents the ginzu application that implements a detect-classify-verify loop that locates the indexes of transients, identifies them using a decision-tree based expert classifier, and then generates a summary event file containing relevant information. The ginzu application provides a command-line interface between streaming preprocessed power data (PREP) and an included graphical user interface. This software was developed using thousands of hours of archived data from the Coast Guard Cutters ESCANABA (WMEC-907) and SENECA (WMEC-906).

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},

We show that simple discriminative methods can directly predict the appliance states (e.g. on, off, standby) and the predicted state can be used to calculate energy consumed by the appliances. We also show that these methods perform substantially better than the generative models of energy consumption that are commonly used. We evaluated the proposed approach using publicly available REDD data set, and our experimental evaluation demonstrates the improvement in accuracy.},

Limitations of inexpensive commercial devices such as resolution and measurement accuracy are a challenge. An algorithm currently under development, specifically developed for the low resolution of inexpensive commercial sensor packages, will be discussed and demonstrated. This information can then be used to verify the effectiveness of various smart grid initiatives in addition to other energy saving protocols such as weather proofing and energy efficient appliances. In addition, this information can be used to select devices for distributed control by analyzing not only the type of device but also the real world operating characteristics.},

Appliances should however only be disconnected from mains when no negative side effects, e.g., loss of data or thawing food, are incurred thereby. This motivates the use of appliance identification techniques, which determine the type of an attached appliance based on the continuous sampling of its power consumption. While various implementations based on different sampling resolutions have been presented in existing literature, the achievable classification accuracies have rarely been analyzed. We address this shortcoming and evaluate the accuracy of appliance identification based on the characteristic features of traces collected during the 24 hours of a day. We evaluate our algorithm using more than 1,000 traces of different electrical appliances' power consumptions. The results show that our approach can identify most of the appliances at high accuracy.},

Changes in lighting and the effects of perspective also pose no problems. How do we achieve this, and more importantly, how can we get a computer to do this? One very promising approach is to find mathematical functions of an object's image, or of an object's 3D description, that are invariant to the transformations caused by the object's motion. This book is devoted to the theory and practice of such invariant image features, so-called image invariants, for planar objects. It gives a comprehensive summary of the field, discussing methods for recognizing both occluded and partially occluded objects, and also contains a definitive treatmentof moment invariants and a tutorial introduction to algebraic invariants, which are fundamental to affine moment invariants and to many projective invariants. A number of novel invariant functions are presented and the results of numerous experiments investigating the stability of new and old invariants are discussed. The main conclusion is that moment invariants are very effective, both for partially occluded objects and for recognizing objects in grey-level images.},

  Abstract                 = {Between now and 2020 more than 50 million new ‘smart meters’ are being rolled out to 30
million homes and smaller non-domestic sites in Britain. These smart meters, which will
include an offer of a free in-home-display for households, are intended to allow consumers to
see and adjust in real time what energy they are using.
Ofgem considers that smart metering could “transform how energy markets operate”. The
Government estimates that over the next 20 years, the roll-out of smart meters will deliver
about £7 billion of net benefits to consumers, energy suppliers and networks. Since 2009, DECC and Ofgem have been working on a roll-out programme.
The National Audit Office (NAO) and the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) have raised
concerns about the ambition of the programme, its risks and the extent of the potential
benefits to consumers. In two reports PAC considered the challenges associated with roll-out
‘huge’ and the benefits slim. DECC stated in May 2013 that it now expects suppliers to be
ready to start their full scale roll-out by autumn 2015, for completion by 2020.
Issues that may be of concern to constituents include the extent to which smart meters will
be mandated, consumer protection during the installation process, and concerns about
privacy and access to smart metering data. Suppliers must operate in line with an installation
code of practice which came into force on 1 June 2013, backed by legislation. Among other
things, this bans face-to-face marketing activity of specific products without prior consent
during installations, with a complete ban on completing any sales. On data access, energy
suppliers will be able to access consumption data on a monthly basis, with a clear consumer
opt-out for daily access by suppliers and an opt-in for more frequent access. Concerns have
also been raised by some groups about health effects from smart meters.
The licence conditions for the roll-out of gas and electricity smart metering equipment and a
code of practice for the installation of smart metering equipment came into force on
30 November 2012. Licence conditions relating to other aspects of the smart metering rollout
including a consumer engagement strategy most of those relating to data access and
privacy came into force on 4 March 2013.},

show that by adding a well chosen penalty
term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those
attained by other regularized auto-encoders

on a range of datasets. This penalty term
corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the
Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations
with respect to the input. We show that
this penalty term results in a localized space
contraction which in turn yields robust features
on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to
both regularized auto-encoders and denoising
auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link
between deterministic and non-deterministic
auto-encoders. We nd empirically that this
penalty helps to carve a representation that
better captures the local directions of variation
dictated by the data, corresponding to a
lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while
being more invariant to the vast majority of
directions orthogonal to the manifold.
Finally, we show that by using the learned
features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state
of the art classication error on a range of
datasets, surpassing other methods of pre-training.},

  Abstract                 = {Ice sheet mass balance estimates have improved substantially in recent years using a variety of techniques, over different time periods, and at various levels of spatial detail. Considerable disparity remains between these estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of each method, the lack of detailed comparison between independent estimates, and the effect of temporal modulations in ice sheet surface mass balance. Here, we present a consistent record of mass balance for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the past two decades, validated by the comparison of two independent techniques over the last 8 years: one differencing perimeter loss from net accumulation, and one using a dense time series of time-variable gravity. We find excellent agreement between the two techniques for absolute mass loss and acceleration of mass loss. In 2006, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets experienced a combined mass loss of 475 ± 158 Gt/yr, equivalent to 1.3 ± 0.4 mm/yr sea level rise. Notably, the acceleration in ice sheet loss over the last 18 years was 21.9 ± 1 Gt/yr2 for Greenland and 14.5 ± 2 Gt/yr2 for Antarctica, for a combined total of 36.3 ± 2 Gt/yr2. This acceleration is 3 times larger than for mountain glaciers and ice caps (12 ± 6 Gt/yr2). If this trend continues, ice sheets will be the dominant contributor to sea level rise in the 21st century.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent experimental evidence suggests that the brain is capable of approximating Bayesian inference in the face of noisy input stimuli. Despite this progress, the neural underpinnings of this computation are still poorly understood. In this paper we focus on the Bayesian filtering of stochastic time series and introduce a novel neural network, derived from a line attractor architecture, whose dynamics map directly onto those of the Kalman filter in the limit of small prediction error. When the prediction error is large we show that the network responds robustly to changepoints in a way that is qualitatively compatible with the optimal Bayesian model. The model suggests ways in which probability distributions are encoded in the brain and makes a number of testable experimental predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {Smart meters report power usage at 15 minute intervals and, compared to monthly power
bills, provide the users with a much finer resolution time series of energy usage. However, apart
from identifying times of peak energy usage, these smart meters provide little actionable data for
the user in terms of reducing their power costs. Our research involves the development of an
intelligent metering system that uses non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) to
identify the largest energy usage appliances in a residence or small business. The signal
processing algorithms employed separate the energy used by individual appliances from the total
natural gas and electricity measured at the point where the utilities enter the residence. Utility
ratepayers need detailed information to effectively identify and mitigate inefficient appliances
and activities. The cost to operate each specific appliance is sent, via a secure home area
network, to the user’s computer and accessed via a web browser. An easy to use interactive tool
has been developed to label appliances and present this data to the user. Tests have been
performed in three residences to compare the performance of our load disaggregation system
with that of isolated electrical power measurements from ten or more appliances. Disaggregating
the total energy usage into appliance specific usage will transform ratepayers’ ability to conserve
energy. Inefficient appliances can be identified, usage patterns can be shifted to lower tariffs
times, failing appliances can be detected before they fail, and energy efficient measures can be
implemented based on a true cost-benefit calculation.},

The implementation of classification capability in future transient recorders will enable such features as selective storage of transient data (to better utilize limited storage media) and automated reporting of disturbances to central control facilities. The wavelet transform provides an effective and efficient means of decomposing voltage and current signals of power system transients to detectable and discriminant features. Similarities of power system transients to wide-band signals in other domains, the simultaneous presence of a resonant frequency, its harmonics, and impulse (high-frequency, time-localized) components, make this technique extendible to other classification systems. The classification algorithm uses statistical pattern recognition on features derived from the extreme representation of the transient waveform after processing the transient waveform by a non-orthogonal, quadratic spline wavelet. Training and classification testing use simulated waveforms of a 200 mile, three-phase transmission line produced by the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). A simple Bayesian classifier identifies an unknown transient waveform as a capacitor switching or fault transient, and locates the point of disturbance from one of two possible locations on the transmission line. Due to the effectiveness of the wavelet transform preprocessing, the classification system currently performs at 100 percent accuracy on four transient classes.},

Training via backpropagation-through-time initially minimizes an unsupervised sparse reconstruction error; the loss function is then augmented with a discriminative term on the supervised classification. The depth implicit in the temporally-unrolled form allows the system to exhibit all the power of deep networks, while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters.
From an initially unstructured network the hidden units differentiate into categorical-units, each of which represents an input prototype with a well-defined class; and part-units representing deformations of these prototypes. The learned organization of the recurrent encoder is hierarchical: part-units are driven directly by the input, whereas the activity of categorical-units builds up over time through interactions with the part-units. Even using a small number of hidden units per layer, discriminative recurrent sparse auto-encoders achieve excellent performance on MNIST.},

  Abstract                 = {The success of demand side energy control in industries, mines and commercial buildings depends on factors like the energy sensitivity and awareness of the organisation as well as an accurate and effective measurement and monitoring of its electrical energy consumption. Demand side energy control also forms an important part in the research programs of many research organisations. Reliable data on energy consumption is therefore imperative for effective research in this field, as well as for the successful implementation of demand side management. Traditional load research instrumentation has involved intrusive techniques that require the installation of sensors on each of the individual components of the total load. A non-intrusive appliance load monitor is proposed in this paper to determine the energy consumption of individual appliances turning on or off or operating under continuously varying load conditions. This monitoring system, which is implemented by network pattern identification technology, is based on detailed analysis of the current and voltage of the total load, as measured at the interface of the power source. The approach has been developed to simplify the collection of energy consumption data by utilities, but also has other applications. It is called nonintrusive to contrast it with previous techniques for gathering appliance data, which require placing sensors on individual appliances, and hence an intrusion onto the energy consumer's property.},

The authors propose a formal description of the FSM and its output, using a regular phrase-structured grammar. This description is associated with a cost measuring its information content. The authors then state the inference problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with an objective function define as the cost of the description of the FSM and its output. A heuristic algorithm is proposed which processes the output âon lineâ and yields a local minimum of the authors' criterion. At each step (i.e. as new data is observed and processed), the procedure searches locally through the space of non-probabilistic FSMs, i.e., the transitions are initially regarded as being only present or absent. When a non-probabilistic model has been generated, the transition probabilities are determined from their relative frequencies given the behavior indicated by the data. This yields maximum likelihood estimates of the probabilities. The costs of the obtained probabilistic FSMs are then computed, and the K minimum cost FSMs are kept as starting points for the next step search. At each step, the generation of the FSMs is done via a local search through the neighborhoods of the K best FSMs obtained at the previous step. This algorithm is compared with similar algorithms proposed previously, and tested on a range of examples. It is found to work for a wider range of FSMs than the previous methods, and it is much more practical for large problems than previously proposed exhaustive search techniques},

  Abstract                 = {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a promising technique for disaggregating per-appliance energy consumption in buildings from aggregate voltage/current measurements. One major limitation of the approach is that it typically requires a training phase during which users must manually label device transitions. In this paper, we present an inexpensive contactless electromagnetic field (EMF) event-detector that can detect appliance state changes within close proximity based on magnetic and electric field fluctuations. Each detector wirelessly transmits state changes to a circuit-panel energy meter, which can then be used to label and disambiguate appliance transitions detected from the aggregate signals as well as to track the associated energy consumption. Our EMF sensors are able to detect significant power state changes from a few inches away making it possible to externally monitor in-wall wiring to devices (e.g., overhead lights). We experimentally evaluate our proposed EMF sensor in terms of power consumption, accuracy and detection range on a variety of appliances to demonstrate its effectiveness towards augmenting NILM systems. We show that accurately detecting 100W loads from 10cm away is possible while maintaining multiple-year battery life from a coin-cell battery.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensing, monitoring and actuating systems are expected to play a key role in reducing buildings overall energy consumption. Leveraging sensor systems to support energy efficiency in buildings poses novel research challenges in monitoring space usage, controlling devices, interfacing with smart energy meters and communicating with the energy grid. In the attempt of reducing electricity consumption in buildings, identifying individual sources of energy consumption is key to generate energy awareness and improve efficiency of available energy resources usage. Previous work studied several non-intrusive load monitoring techniques to classify appliances; however, the literature lacks of an comprehensive system that can be easily installed in existing buildings to empower users profiling, benchmarking and recognizing loads in real-time. This has been a major reason holding back the practice adoption of load monitoring techniques. In this paper we present RECAP: RECognition of electrical Appliances and Profiling in real-time. RECAP uses a single wireless energy monitoring sensor easily clipped to the main electrical unit. The energy monitoring unit transmits energy data wirelessly to a local machine for data processing and storage. The RECAP system consists of three parts: (1) Guiding the user for profiling electrical appliances within premises and generating a database of unique appliance signatures; (2) Using those signatures to train an artificial neural network that is then employed to recognize appliance activities (3) Providing a Load descriptor to allow peer appliance benchmarking. RECAP addresses the need of an integrated and intuitive tool to empower building owners with energy awareness. Enabling real-time appliance recognition is a stepping-stone towards reducing energy consumption and allowing a number of major applications including load-shifting techniques, energy expenditure breakdown per appliance, detection of power hungry and faulty appliances, and recognition of occupant activity. This paper describes the system design and performance evaluation in domestic environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Electric power systems, around the world, are changing in terms of structure, operation, management and ownership due to technical, financial and ideological reasons. Power system keeps on expanding in terms of geographical areas, assets additions, and penetration of new technologies in generation, transmission and distribution. This makes the electric power system complex, heavily stressed and thereby vulnerable to cascade outages. The conventional methods in solving the power system design, planning, operation and control problems have been very extensively used for different applications but these methods suffer from several difficulties due to necessities of derivative existence, providing suboptimal solutions, etc. Computation intelligent (CI) methods can give better solution in several conditions and are being widely applied in the electrical engineering applications. This paper highlights the application of computational intelligence methods in power system problems. Various types of CI methods, which are widely used in power system, are also discussed in the brief.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in low-power wireless networking have enabled remote and nonintrusive access to households' electric meter readings, allowing direct real-time feedback on electricity consumption to home owners and energy providers. Fine-grained electricity billing based on appliance power load monitoring has been investigated for more than two decades, but has not yet witnessed wide commercial acceptance. In this paper, we argue that the required human supervision for profiling and calibrating appliance load monitoring systems is a key reason preventing large-scale commercial roll-outs. We propose ANNOT, a system to automate electricity data annotation leveraging cheap wireless sensor nodes. Characteristic sensory stimuli captured by sensor nodes placed next to appliances are translated into appliance operating state and correlated to the electricity data, autonomously generating the annotation of electricity data with appliance activity. The system is able to facilitate the acquisition of appliance signatures, training data and validate the monitoring output. We validate the concept by integrating the automated annotation system to the RECAP appliance load monitoring system.},

Previous estimates of global hydrographic fluctuations have been derived using different data sets, partly on the basis of scarce sampling. The substantial advantage of this study includes a detailed summary of global variability patterns based on a single and more uniform database. In the upper 400 m, regions of strong seasonal salinity changes differ from regions of strong seasonal temperature changes, and large amplitudes of seasonal salinity are observed in the upper tropical and subpolar global ocean. Strong interannual and decadal changes superimpose long-term changes at northern midlatitudes. In the subtropical and tropical basin, interannual fluctuations dominate the upper 500 m depth. At southern midlatitudes, hydrographic changes occur on interannual and decadal time scales, while long-term changes are predominantly observed in the salinity field. Global mean heat content and steric height changes are clearly associated with a positive trend during the 6 years of measurements. The global 6-year trend of steric height deduced from in situ measurements explains 40% of the satellite-derived quantities. The global freshwater content does not show a significant trend and is dominated by interannual variability.},

Here, we pursue both topics in examining how the Hawthorne effect emerges in a large field experiment focused on residential consumers' electricity use. These consumers received five postcards notifying, and then reminding, them of their participation in a study of household electricity use. We found evidence for a Hawthorne (study participation) effect, seen in a reduction of their electricity use--even though they received no information, instruction, or incentives to change. Responses to a follow-up survey suggested that the effect reflected heightened awareness of energy consumption. Consistent with that interpretation, the treatment effect vanished when the intervention ended.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the great societal challenges that we face today concerns the move to more sustainable patterns of energy consumption, reflecting the need to balance both individual consumer choice and societal demands. In order for this energy turnaround' to take place, however, reducing residential energy consumption must go beyond using energy-efficient devices: More sustainable behaviour and lifestyles are essential parts of future energy aware' living. Addressing this issue from an HCI perspective, this paper presents the results of a 3-year research project dealing with the co-design and appropriation of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that has been rolled out in a living lab setting with seven households for a period of 18 months. Our HEMS is inspired by feedback systems in Sustainable Interaction Design and allows the monitoring of energy consumption in real-time. In contrast to existing research mainly focusing on how technology can persuade people to consume less energy ( what technology does to people'), our study focuses on the appropriation of energy feedback systems ( what people do with technology') and how newly developed practices can become a resource for future technology design. Therefore, we deliberately followed an open research design. In keeping with this approach, our study uncovers various responses, practices and obstacles of HEMS use. We show that HEMS use is characterized by a number of different features. Recognizing the distinctive patterns of technology use in the different households and the evolutionary character of that use within the households, we conclude with a discussion of these patterns in relation to existing research and their meaning for the design of future HEMSs.},

  Abstract                 = {Uncertainty in the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) Arctic sea ice volume record is characterized. A range of observations and approaches, including in situ ice thickness measurements, ICESat retrieved ice thickness, and model sensitivity studies, yields a conservative estimate for October Arctic ice volume uncertainty of 1.35 × 103 km3 and an uncertainty of the ice volume trend over the 1979–2010 period of 1.0 × 103 km3 decade–1. A conservative estimate of the trend over this period is −2.8 × 103 km3 decade–1. PIOMAS ice thickness estimates agree well with ICESat ice thickness retrievals (<0.1 m mean difference) for the area for which submarine data are available, while difference outside this area are larger. PIOMAS spatial thickness patterns agree well with ICESat thickness estimates with pattern correlations of above 0.8. PIOMAS appears to overestimate thin ice thickness and underestimate thick ice, yielding a smaller downward trend than apparent in reconstructions from observations. PIOMAS ice volume uncertainties and trends are examined in the context of climate change attribution and the declaration of record minima. The distribution of 32 year trends in a preindustrial coupled model simulation shows no trends comparable to those seen in the PIOMAS retrospective, even when the trend uncertainty is accounted for. Attempts to label September minima as new record lows are sensitive to modeling error. However, the September 2010 ice volume anomaly did in fact exceed the previous 2007 minimum by a large enough margin to establish a statistically significant new record.},

We deployed PreHeat in five homes, three in the US and two in the UK. In UK homes, we controlled heating on a per-room basis to enable further energy savings. We compared PreHeat's prediction algorithm with a static program over an average 61 days per house, alternating days between these conditions, and measuring actual gas consumption and occupancy. In UK homes PreHeat both saved gas and reduced MissTime (the time that the house was occupied but not warm). In US homes, PreHeat decreased MissTime by a factor of 6-12, while consuming a similar amount of gas. In summary, PreHeat enables more efficient heating while removing the need for users to program thermostat schedules.},

But recent studies are showing that the tropics are also changing. Several lines of evidence show that over the past few decades the tropical belt has expanded. This expansion has potentially important implications for subtropical societies and may lead to profound changes in the global climate system. Most importantly, poleward movement of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as jet streams and storm tracks, could result in shifts in precipitation patterns affecting natural ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources. The implications of the expansion for stratospheric circulation and the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere are as yet poorly understood. The observed recent rate of expansion is greater than climate model projections of expansion over the twenty-first century, which suggests that there is still much to be learned about this aspect of global climate change.},

popular approach to study energy consumption patterns
without instrumenting every device in an installation. The
resulting computational problem is to disaggregate total en-
ergy usage into usage by specific circuits and devices, to gain
insight into consumption patterns. We exploit the temporal
ordering implicit in on/off events of devices to uncover mo-
tifs (episodes) corresponding to the operation of individual
devices. Extracted motifs are then subjected to a sequence
of constraint checks to ensure that the resulting episodes are
interpretable. Our preliminary results show that motif min-
ing is adept at distinguishing devices with multiple power
levels and at disentangling the combinatorial operation of
devices},

  Abstract                 = {Computer vision is a rapidly growing field which aims to make computers see as effectively as humans. In this book Dr Shapiro presents a new computer vision framework for interpreting time-varying imagery. This is an important task, since movement reveals valuable information about the environment. The fully-automated system operates on long, monocular image sequences containing multiple, independently-moving objects, and demonstrates the practical feasibility of recovering scene structure and motion in a bottom-up fashion. Real and synthetic examples are given throughout, with particular emphasis on image coding applications. Novel theory is derived in the context of the affine camera, a generalisation of the familiar scaled orthographic model. Analysis proceeds by tracking 'corner features' through successive frames and grouping the resulting trajectories into rigid objects using new clustering and outlier rejection techniques. The three-dimensional motion parameters are then computed via affine epipolar geometry, and affine structure is used to generate alternative views of the object and fill in partial views. The use of all available features (over multiple frames) and the incorporation of statistical noise properties substantially improves existing algorithms, giving greater reliability and reduced noise sensitivity.},

A three-phase balanced induction motor is assumed. Measurements of the stator currents and voltages are required for the identification procedure, but no measurements from the motor shaft are needed. The first method presented applies simple models with limited temporal domains of validity and obtains parameter estimates by extrapolating the model error bias to zero. This method does not minimize any specific error criterion and is presented as a means of finding a good initial guess for a conventional iterative maximum-likelihood or least-squares estimator. The second method presented minimizes equation errors in the induction motor model in the least-square sense using a Levenburg-Marquardt iteration. The third identification method is a continuation of the Levenburg-Marquardt method, motivated by observed properties of some pathological loss functions. The third method minimizes errors in the observations in the least-squared sense and is, therefore, a maximum-likelihood estimator under appropriate conditions of normality. The performance of the identification schemes is demonstrated with both simulated and measured data, and parameters obtained using the methods are compared with parameters obtained from standard tests},

We employ standard tools from discriminative object detection in a novel way, yielding a generic approach that does not depend on a particular image representation or a specific visual domain. Our approach shows good performance on a number of difficult cross-domain visual tasks e.g., matching paintings or sketches to real photographs. The method also allows us to demonstrate novel applications such as Internet re-photography, and painting2gps. While at present the technique is too computationally intensive to be practical for interactive image retrieval, we hope that some of the ideas will eventually become applicable to that domain as well.},

Based on the test data, a modified on-line support vector regression model was proposed for characteristic function approximation, in which the model parameters can be continuously adapted for changes in coal quality and other conditions of plant equipment. The optimization scheme was implemented by a genetic algorithm in two stages. Firstly, the multi-objective combustion optimization problem was solved to achieve an optimal Pareto front, which contains optimal solutions for lowest unit heat rate and lowest NOx emissions. Secondly, best operating settings for the boiler, and SCR system and air preheater were obtained for lowest operating cost under the constraints of NOx emissions limit and air preheater ammonium bisulfate deposition depth.},

Our multidisciplinary research is being undertaken in a set of nominally identical townhouses in Twin Rivers, New Jersey, a recently built community of standard construction with gas space heating, electric central air conditioning, and a full set of appliances.

Average levels of energy consumption and their dependence on weather and building type have been established, thereby permitting detailed quantitative studies of the sources of remaining variability. Starting from this baseline, we have established the level of change in energy consumption that followed the “energy crisis” in the autumn of 1973 and we have performed two kinds of controlled experiments: (1) experiments where a set of modifications (retrofits) are made to the building structure, and (2) experiments where “feedback” is provided to residents, on a regular basis, reporting their level of consumption of energy. Conclusions drawn from our modeling and experimentation are presented here, with emphasis given to those results bearing directly on the character of programs to retrofit the national housing stock.

Photographs of the site, of building defects, and of our retrofits are included, as well as a selection of graphical displays of data, each a snapshot of a kind of analysis we have found useful and are prepared to recommend to others who wish to help develop an understanding of how houses work.

Lists are included both of the program's reports and publications and of the people who have contributed to the Twin Rivers program since its inception.},

  Abstract                 = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450–600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the “dust bowl” era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4–1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6–1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding ≈1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Most commentators expect improved energy efficiency and reduced energy demand to provide the dominant contribution to tackling global climate change. But at the global level, the correlation between increased wealth and increased energy consumption is very strong and the impact of policies to reduce energy demand is both limited and contested. Different academic disciplines approach energy demand reduction in different ways: emphasising some mechanisms and neglecting others, being more or less optimistic about the potential for reducing energy demand and providing insights that are more or less useful for policymakers. This article provides an overview of the main issues and challenges associated with energy demand reduction, summarises how this challenge is ‘framed’ by key academic disciplines, indicates how these can provide complementary insights for policymakers and argues that a ‘sociotechnical’ perspective can provide a deeper understanding of the nature of this challenge and the processes through which it can be achieved. The article integrates ideas from the natural sciences, economics, psychology, innovation studies and sociology but does not give equal weight to each. It argues that reducing energy demand will prove more difficult than is commonly assumed and current approaches will be insufficient to deliver the transformation required.},

In this approach, NNs are trained to extract important features from the input current waveform to uniquely identify various types of devices using their distinct harmonic "signatures". Such automated, noninvasive device identification will be critical in future power-quality monitoring and enhancement systems. Several NN-based classification models including multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) network, and support vector machines (SVM) with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels were developed for signature extraction and device identification. These models were trained and tested using spike train data gathered from the Fourier analysis of the input current waveform in the presence of multiple devices. The performance of these models was compared in terms of their accuracy, generalization ability, and noise tolerance limits. The results showed that MLPs and SVM were both able to determine the presence of devices based on their harmonic signatures with high accuracy. MLP was found to be the best signature identification method because of its low computational requirements and ability to extract the information necessary for highly accurate device identification.},

Trends in the phase and the amplitude of the annual cycle have been observed, but the causes and significance of these changes remain poorly understood—in part because we lack an understanding of the natural variability. Here we show that the phase of the annual cycle of surface temperature over extratropical land shifted towards earlier seasons by 1.7 days between 1954 and 2007; this change is highly anomalous with respect to earlier variations, which we interpret as being indicative of the natural range. Significant changes in the amplitude of the annual cycle are also observed between 1954 and 2007. These shifts in the annual cycles appear to be related, in part, to changes in the northern annular mode of climate variability, although the land phase shift is significantly larger than that predicted by trends in the northern annular mode alone. Few of the climate models presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reproduce the observed decrease in amplitude and none reproduce the shift towards earlier seasons.},

Sugihara presents a computational mechanism that functionally mimics human perception in being able to generate three-dimensional descriptions of objects from two-dimensional line drawings. The objects considered are polyhedrons or solid objects bounded by planar faces, and the line drawings are single-view pictures of these objects.

Sugihara's mechanism has several potential applications. It can facilitate man-machine communication by extracting object structures automatically from pictures drawn by a designer, which can be particularly useful in the computer-aided design of geometric objects, such as mechanical parts and buildings. It can also be used in the intermediate stage of computer vision systems used to obtain and analyze images in the outside world. The computational mechanism itself is not accompanied by a large database but is composed of several simple procedures based on linear algebra and combinatorial theory.

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring is a problem to identify the operating conditions of the electric appliances in a house only by observing the overall load current and voltage. Since the overall load current is expressed as a superposition of each current of the operating appliance, the monitoring problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic programming problem by expressing the operating conditions as integer variables. This problem is solvable with sufficiently small computational burden thanks to the recent development of the commercial software. The proposed method does not require the relearning even when a new appliance is installed in the house. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is applicable to cases that some appliance has multiple modes, and cases that some same-type appliances operate simultaneously. Usefulness of the proposed technique is verified through some experimental results.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a growing interest in reducing energy consumption and the associated greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy. The residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies suitable for residential applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method. Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different applicability. A critical review of each technique, focusing on the strengths, shortcomings and purposes, is provided along with a review of models reported in the literature.},

The proposed model achieves a single digit error of 1.5% compared to 2.9% for a convolutional networks and 2.0% for convolutional networks with SPN layers. The SPN outputs a zoomed, rotated and skewed version of the input image. We investigate different down-sampling factors (ratio of pixel in input and output) for the SPN and show that the RNN-SPN model is able to down-sample the input images without deteriorating performance. The down-sampling in RNN-SPN can be thought of as adaptive down-sampling that minimizes the information loss in the regions of interest. We attribute the superior performance of the RNN-SPN to the fact that it can attend to a sequence of regions of interest.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy disaggregation is to discover the energy consumption of individual appliances from their aggregated energy values. To solve the problem, most existing approaches rely on either appliances' signatures or their state transition patterns, both hard to obtain in practice. Aiming at developing a simple, universal model that works without depending on sophisticated machine learning techniques or auxiliary equipments, we make use of easily accessible knowledge of appliances and the sparsity of the switching events to design a Sparse Switching Event Recovering (SSER) method. By minimizing the total variation (TV) of the (sparse) event matrix, SSER can effectively recover the individual energy consumption values from the aggregated ones. To speed up the process, a Parallel Local Optimization Algorithm (PLOA) is proposed to solve the problem in active epochs of appliance activities in parallel. Using real-world trace data, we compare the performance of our method with that of the state-of-the-art solutions, including Least Square Estimation (LSE) and iterative Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The results show that our approach has an overall higher detection accuracy and a smaller overhead.},

To fill this gap, this paper discusses the design and performance evaluation of the Tiny Energy Accounting and Reporting System (TinyEARS), a fine-grained energy monitoring system that generates devicelevel power consumption reports primarily based on the acoustic signatures of household appliances. Experiments demonstrate that TinyEARS is able to report the power consumption of individual household appliances within a 10% error margin.},

They show that the way we think can be used to our advantage: it is possible to design environments that make it more likely for us to act in our own interests.

  Abstract                 = {The ICT sector has transformed the way we live,
work, learn and play. From mobile phones and
micro-computer chips to the internet, ICT has
consistently delivered innovative products and
services that are now an integral part of everyday
life. ICT has systematically increased productivity
and supported economic growth across both
developed and developing countries. But what
impact do pervasive information and
communication technologies have on global
warming? Is it a sector that will hinder or help
our fight against dangerous climate change?
To answer these questions, this report
has quantified the direct emissions from ICT
products and services based on expected
growth in the sector. It also looked at where ICT
could enable significant reductions of emissions
in other sectors of the economy and has quantified
these in terms of CO2e emission savings and
cost savings.
Aside from emissions associated with
deforestation, the largest contribution to
man-made GHG emissions comes from power
generation and fuel used for transportation.
It is therefore not surprising that the biggest role
ICTs could play is in helping to improve energy
efficiency in power transmission and distribution
(T&D), in buildings and factories that demand
power and in the use of transportation to
deliver goods.
In total, ICTs could deliver
approximately 7.8 GtCO2e of emissions savings
in 2020. This represents 15% of emissions in 2020
based on a BAU estimation. It represents a
significant proportion of the reductions below
1990 levels that scientists and economists
recommend by 2020 to avoid dangerous climate
change1 In economic terms, the ICT-enabled
energy efficiency translates into approximately
¤600 billion ($946.5 billion2
) of cost savings.3
It is an opportunity that cannot be overlooked.
Our analysis identifies some of the biggest and
most accessible opportunities for ICT to achieve
these savings.
•Smart motor systems: A review of
manufacturing in China has identified that
without optimisation, 10% of China’s emissions
(2% of global emissions) in 2020 will come from
China’s motor systems alone and to improve
industrial efficiency even by 10% would deliver
up to 200 million tonnes (Mt) CO2e savings.
Applied globally, optimised motors and
industrial automation would reduce 0.97 GtCO2e
in 2020, worth ¤68 billion ($107.2 billion).4
• Smart logistics: Through a host of efficiencies
in transport and storage, smart logistics in
Europe could deliver fuel, electricity and heating
savings of 225 MtCO2e. The global emissions
savings from smart logistics in 2020 would reach
1.52 GtCO2e, with energy savings worth
¤280 billion ($441.7 billion).
• Smart buildings: A closer look at buildings in
North America indicates that better building
design, management and automation could save
15% of North America’s buildings emissions.
Globally, smart buildings technologies would
enable 1.68 GtCO2e of emissions savings, worth
¤216 billion ($340.8 billion).
• Smart grids: Reducing T&D losses in India’s
power sector by 30% is possible through better
monitoring and management of electricity
grids, first with smart meters and then by
integrating more advanced ICTs into the
so-called energy internet. Smart grid
technologies were the largest opportunity
found in the study and could globally reduce
2.03 GtCO2e , worth ¤79 billion ($124.6 billion).},

is unobservable (i.e., hidden or latent). As a result, the algorithm
iterates the forward-backward algorithm and the parameter generation
algorithm for the case where state sequence is given. Experimental
results show that by using the algorithm, we can reproduce

Emerging solution provides privacy breach minimization by supervised learning through training that incurs higher capex and opex. IoT systems do not consist of human-in-loop. So, involuntary approach of privacy preservation is to be employed. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for addressing the problem of involuntary privacy breaching risk minimization in smart energy management systems. Our proposed solution `Dynamic Privacy Analyzer' scheme is an attempt towards achieving a unique privacy metric that is derived from fundamental principles like robust statistics and information theory. We analyze the performance of our scheme with large set of publicly available real smart meter datasets and evaluate optimality criteria like utility-privacy trade-off. Efficacy of our proposed scheme is demonstrated by minimizing the capability of privacy intruders like NILM. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time the involuntary privacy-aware scheme tailored for IoT system is proposed. Our proposed scheme is generic enough to suit in other IoT applications.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method is proposed for modelling state duration in hidden Markov model (HMM) speech recognition systems. State transition probabilities are expressed conditional on how long the current state has been occupied. The conventional fixed-state transition probabilities aij are replaced by duration-dependent variables aij(d) that depend on the time d already spent in state i. In this way, state transition and state duration probabilities are combined to form duration-dependent transition probabilities. The transition probabilities are derived from the cumulative density function (CDF) of state duration. The training of \{HMMs\} with duration-dependent transitions are based on maximum likelihood segmentation of training data, using the Viterbi algorithm. At each training iteration, the current \{HMM\} parameters are used to segment every training example. All the segments associated with each state are then used to update state observation and transition parameters. In experiments with a data set of spoken English alphabet, durational modelling improves the recognition accuracy by 5.6%.},

  Abstract                 = {This started with a tweet. I’m embarrassed how often that happens.

Frustrated by a sense of global mispriorities, I blurted out some snarky and mildly regrettable tweets on the lack of attention to climate change in the tech industry (Twitter being a sublime medium for the snarky and regrettable). Climate change is the problem of our time, it’s everyone’s problem, and most of our problem-solvers are assuming that someone else will solve it.

I’m grateful to one problem-solver, who wrote to ask for specifics —

“How do you think the tech community (startup community, or any community) can contribute to tech and/or policy solutions on a global scale?”

The notes below are my attempt to answer that question.

This is a “personal view”, biased by my experiences and idiosyncrasies. I’ve followed the climate situation for some time, including working on Al Gore’s book Our Choice, but I can’t hope to convey the full picture — just a sliver that’s visible from where I’m standing. I urge you to talk to many scientists and engineers involved in climate analysis and energy, and see for yourself what the needs are and how you can contribute.

This is aimed at people in the tech industry, and is more about what you can do with your career than at a hackathon. I’m not going to discuss policy and regulation, although they’re no less important than technological innovation. A good way to think about it, via Saul Griffith, is that it’s the role of technologists to create options for policy-makers.

I’m also only going to directly discuss technology related to the primary cause of climate change (the burning of fossil fuels), although there are technological needs related to other causes (livestock, deforestation, global poverty), as well as mitigating symptoms of climate change (droughts and storms, ecosystem damage, mass migrations).

Thus, designers must be concerned with both optimizing and estimating the energy consumption of circuits, architectures, and software. Most of the research in energy optimization and/or estimation has focused on single components of the system and has not looked across the interacting spectrum of the hardware and software. The novelty of our new energy estimation framework, SimplePower, is that it evaluates the energy considering the system as a whole rather than just as a sum of parts, and that it concurrently supports both compiler and architectural experimentation.

We present the design and use of the SimplePower framework that includes a transition-sensitive, cycle-accurate datapath energy model that interfaces with analytical and transition sensitive energy models for the memory and bus subsystems, respectively. We analyzed the energy consumption of ten codes from the multidimensional array domain, a domain that is important for embedded video and signal processing systems, after applying different compiler and architectural optimizations. Our experiments demonstrate that early estimates from the SimplePower energy estimation framework can help identify the system energy hotspots and enable architects and compiler designers to focus their efforts on these areas.},

This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite.},

Application of multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods to the behavioral data enabled us to identify 29 discrete, statistically distinguishable, observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes. Mapping the neural lines to the behavior(s) they evoke provides a behavioral reference atlas for neuron subsets covering a large fraction of larval neurons. This atlas is a starting point for connectivity- and activity-mapping studies to further investigate the mechanisms by which neurons mediate diverse behaviors.},

  Abstract                 = {Modelling power systems is an area of ongoing interest in the transmission management and control systems community. Continuing development is driven by two forces. The traditional tasks of model maintenance and management must be achieved with fewer resources. At the same time, model exchange and coordination has become a priority. The latter force arises from the disaggregation of utility functions and the introduction of power markets. This paper begins by identifying some of the power system modelling tasks that have become important, but are ill served by current tools and techniques. Among these are model versioning and version control, migration of models between, different schema, the transformation of models for different purposes or applications, and the merging of models from different sources. These tasks are typically handled by semi-manual methods or heavily customized software. The paper then describes the application of knowledge representation to power system modelling. In particular, the power of this approach to provide generic solutions to the, foregoing problems is explored. Knowledge representation is contrasted with more common data representations and put into context with current industry initiatives, EPRI CIM (common information model), UMS DAF (data access facility) and XML/CIM. Finally, the feasibility of using knowledge representation for power system models is illustrated with a case study from a major Australian distribution utility},

Our analysis is based on projections from six IPCC models, selected subject to an observational constraints.

  Abstract                 = {There is a need for flexible, inexpensive metering technologies that can be deployed in many different monitoring scenarios. Individual loads may be expected to compute information about their power consumption. Utility providers, facilities managers, and other consumers will likely find innumerable ways to mine information if made available in a useful form. However, appropriate sensing and information delivery systems remain a chief bottleneck for many applications, and metering hardware and access to metered information will likely limit the implementation of new electric energy conservation strategies in the near future. This thesis presents solutions for two long standing problems in nonintrusive power and diagnostic monitoring. First, a high-resolution, physically windowed sensor architecture that is well-suited for energy score-keeping and diagnostic applications will be discussed. The sensor can track a large-scale main signal while capturing small-scale variations. The prototype system uses digital techniques to reconstruct an observed current with a high effective bit resolution. The sensor measures a small current signal using a closed-loop Hall sensor. and extends the range by driving a compensation current with a high performance current source through an auxiliary winding. The system combines the compensation command and the sampled output of the residual sensor to reconstruct the input signal with high bit resolution and bandwidth. Second, a long-standing problem in nonintrusive power monitoring involves the tracking of power consumption in the in the presence of loads with a continuously variable power demand. Two new techniques have been developed for automatically disaggregating, in real-time. different classes of continuously variable power electronic loads which draw distorted line currents. Experimental results of the proposed power estimator extracting the power consumption of common variable power loads such as a variable speed drive, a computer, and a light dimmer are presented.},

Change-points often represent important events in the underlying processes, like a change in brain state reflected in EEG data or a change in the value of a company reflected in its stock price. However, change-points can be difficult to identify in noisy data streams. Previous attempts to identify change-points online using Bayesian inference relied on specifying in advance the rate at which they occur, called the hazard rate (h). This approach leads to predictions that can depend strongly on the choice of h and is unable to deal optimally with systems in which h is not constant in time. In this letter, we overcome these limitations by developing a hierarchical extension to earlier models. This approach allows h itself to be inferred from the data, which in turn helps to identify when change-points occur. We show that our approach can effectively identify change-points in both toy and real data sets with complex hazard rates and how it can be used as an ideal-observer model for human and animal behavior when faced with rapidly changing inputs.},

Methods that reward energy conservation in a number of ways have yielded meaningful short-run reductions. Extensions of current strategies and other procedures derived from a framework presented in the paper may eventually result in more pervasive, longer-term savings. In the light of that objective, the paper also outlines a number of micro- and macro-level projects, some involving the meshing of behavioral and physical technology, that can be readily conducted in residential and commercial buildings.},

  Abstract                 = {A complete overview of distant automatic speech recognition
The performance of conventional Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems degrades dramatically as soon as the microphone is moved away from the mouth of the speaker. This is due to a broad variety of effects such as background noise, overlapping speech from other speakers, and reverberation. While traditional ASR systems underperform for speech captured with far–field sensors, there are a number of novel techniques within the recognition system as well as techniques developed in other areas of signal processing that can mitigate the deleterious effects of noise and reverberation, as well as separating speech from overlapping speakers.

Distant Speech Recognitionpresents a contemporary and comprehensive description of both theoretic abstraction and practical issues inherent in the distant ASR problem.

Key Features:

Covers the entire topic of distant ASR and offers practical solutions to overcome the problems related to it
Provides documentation and sample scripts to enable readers to construct state–of–the–art distant speech recognition systems
Gives relevant background information in acoustics and filter techniques,
Explains the extraction and enhancement of classification relevant speech features
Describes maximum likelihood as well as discriminative parameter estimation, and maximum likelihood normalization techniques
Discusses the use of multi–microphone configurations for speaker tracking and channel combination
Presents several applications of the methods and technologies described in this book

  Abstract                 = {Although traditional approaches can yield accurate forecasting results of energy consumption, they may suffer from several limitations such as the need for large dataset and the linear assumption. Two novel hybrid dynamic approaches, which are based on the SMN (single multiplicative neuron) model and the iterated nonlinear filters, have been proposed for forecasting energy consumption with small dataset and nonlinearity in our study. The forecasting models are established by using the weights and the biases of SMN model to present the state vector and the output of SMN model to present the observation equation, and the input vector to the SMN model is composed of the known energy consumption values with a rolling mechanism. The SMN model has advantages of better approximation capabilities, simpler network structures and faster learning algorithms. The nonlinear filters can deal with additive noises and can update model parameters when a new observation data arrives due to their iterative algorithm structure. Two case studies of energy consumption have been used to demonstrate the reliability of the proposed models, and the experimental results have indicated that the proposed approaches outperform existing models in forecasting energy consumption.},

All of these methods are simulation free. Analysis of real data demonstrates the usefulness of the approach in general. The new models which allow for data dependence are compared with conventional models where data within segments is assumed independent.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new framework for single-channel source separation that liesbetween the fully supervised and unsupervised setting. Instead of supervision,we provide input features for each source signal and use convex methods toestimate the correlations between these features and the unobserved signaldecomposition. Contextually supervised source separation is a natural fit fordomains with large amounts of data but no explicit supervision; our motivatingapplication is energy disaggregation of hourly smart meter data (the separationof whole-home power signals into different energy uses). Here contextualsupervision allows us to provide itemized energy usage for thousands homes, a taskpreviously impossible due to the need for specialized data collection hardware.On smaller datasets which include labels, we demonstrate that contextualsupervision improves significantly over a reasonable baseline and existingunsupervised methods for source separation. Finally, we analyze the case of ℓ₂ loss theoretically and show that recovery of the signal componentsdepends only on cross-correlation between features for different signals, not oncorrelations between features for the same signal.},

Load recognition for identifying loads being connected and disconnected is applied to a NILM by using a neural network, especially for industrial electrical loads, even though some loads are activated at the nearly same time. In order to accurately decompose the aggregate load into its components, a feature-based model for describing the signatures of individual appliances and load combinations is used. The model will suggest the certain signatures which can be detected for all loads in order to indicate the activities of the separate components. To verify the performance of the model for the features selection, the data sets of the electrical loads and the load recognition techniques apply an electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and a neural network, respectively. The effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition are analyzed and compared by using the back propagation classifier and the learning vector quantization classifier. To obtain a maximum recognition accuracy rate, the calculation of the turn-on transient energy signature employs a window of samples, At, to adaptively segment a transient representative of a class of loads. Experiments performed with a variety of model data sets which reveal the back propagation classifier is superior to the learning quantization classifier in the effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition.},

This modification takes advantage of the sparsity of transitions between appliances' states to decompose the main algorithm, thus making the algorithm complexity linearly proportional to the number of appliances. By consideration of a series of data and integrating a priori information, such as the frequency of use and time on/time off statistics, the algorithm dramatically improves NIALM accuracy as compared to the accuracy of established NIALM algorithms.},

We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. This enables us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky \etal on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},
