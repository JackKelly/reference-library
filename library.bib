  abstract =     {Synaptic plasticity provides the basis for most models of learning, memory and development in neural circuits. To generate realistic results, synapse-specific Hebbian forms of plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and depression, must be augmented by global processes that regulate overall levels of neuronal and network activity. Regulatory processes are often as important as the more intensively studied Hebbian processes in determining the consequences of synaptic plasticity for network function. Recent experimental results suggest several novel mechanisms for regulating levels of activity in conjunction with Hebbian synaptic modification. We review three of them—synaptic scaling, spike-timing dependent plasticity and synaptic redistribution—and discuss their functional implications.},

  abstract =     {This article reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of interventions aiming to encourage households to reduce energy consumption. Thirty-eight studies performed within the field of (applied) social and environmental psychology are reviewed, and categorized as involving either antecedent strategies (i.e. commitment, goal setting, information, modeling) or consequence strategies (i.e. feedback, rewards). Particular attention is given to the following evaluation criteria: (1) to what extent did the intervention result in behavioral changes and/or reductions in energy use, (2) were underlying behavioral determinants examined (e.g. knowledge, attitudes), (3) to what extent could effects be attributed to the interventions and, (4) were effects maintained over longer periods of time? Interestingly, most studies focus on voluntary behavior change, by changing individual knowledge and/or perceptions rather than changing contextual factors (i.e. pay-off structure) which may determine households’ behavioral decisions. Interventions have been employed with varying degrees of success. Information tends to result in higher knowledge levels, but not necessarily in behavioral changes or energy savings. Rewards have effectively encouraged energy conservation, but with rather short-lived effects. Feedback has also proven its merits, in particular when given frequently. Some important issues cloud these conclusions, such as methodological problems. Also, little attention is given to actual environmental impact of energy savings. Often, an intervention's effectiveness is studied without examining underlying psychological determinants of energy use and energy savings. Also, it is not always clear whether effects were maintained over a longer period of time. Recommendations are given to further improve intervention planning and to enhance the effectiveness of interventions.},

A combination of tailored information, goal setting (5%), and tailored feedback was used. The purpose of this study was to examine whether this combination of interventions would result in (i) changes in direct and indirect energy use, (ii) changes in energy-related behaviors, and (iii) changes in behavioral antecedents (i.e. knowledge). After 5 months, households exposed to the combination of interventions saved 5.1%, while households in the control group used 0.7% more energy. Households exposed to the interventions saved significantly more direct energy than households in the control group did. No difference in indirect energy savings emerged. Households exposed to the interventions adopted a number of energy-saving behaviors during the course of the study, whereas households in the control group did so to a lesser extent. Households exposed to the interventions had significantly higher knowledge levels of energy conservation than the control group had. It is argued that if the aim is to effectively encourage household energy conservation, it is necessary to examine changes in energy use, energy-related behaviors and behavioral antecedents.},

This paper identifies the current status, methodologies and challenges of NILM in residential and industrial settings. NILM has advanced substantially in recent years due to improvement in algorithms and methodologies. Currently, the important challenges facing residential NILM are inaccessibility of electricity meter high sampling data, and lack of reliable high resolution datasets. For industrial NILM the identification is more challenging due to increased number of loads and the variability of equipment type, temporal patterns and industrial secrecy. From our examination of data and its use in NILM, we observe that the number of devices that can be recognized and the training period required to achiever recognition is not only a function of the algorithms but more importantly is a function of sampling rates.},

Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.},

Non-intrusive appliances load monitoring (NIALM) is a methodology that aims to breakdown the total power consumption measured by the smart meter in each household into the power consumed by the individual appliances. These detailed information on individual appliances consumptions can influence the users to follow better energy usage profiles so as to achieve energy savings. We introduce a novel energy disaggregation model that considers mutual devices interactions and embeds the information on devices interactions into the Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) representations of the aggregated data. The hidden states in the FHMM were inferred by means of the Viterbi algorithm. Devices’ interaction is a power quality issue that affects the measured power consumed by a device when there are other devices connected to the network. We tested our model using a selected house from the REDD public data set. Our proposed approach showed enhanced results when compared with the standard FHMM. Devices interactions, when observed, enabled us to disaggregate and assign energy consumption for individual devices more accurately.},

Hourly load data, hourly load-temperature regression coefficients and simulation end-use results comprise the algorithm input. The algorithm produces hourly load profiles for air conditioning, lighting, fans and pumps, and miscellaneous loads. Measured data from two end-use metered buildings (an office and a retail store) have been used to validate the algorithm. For the retail store, the algorithm estimates of hourly end use compare remarkably well with the monitored end-use data (average error of less than 5% during daytime operation). For the office building, the algorithm gives a consistent bias of about 12 and 27% in overestimating the HVAC and lighting electric loads, respectively, at the expense of underestimating the miscellaenous load by 35%. Results may be attributed to the presence of inconsistencies between office audit information and measured end-use data. A three-fold difference between the auditor's estimate for miscellaneous energy use and the metered amount has been found. The validation, however, indicates great promise for application of the algorithm to whole-building load data for obtaining reliable end-use data.},

Existing approaches have typically proposed remotely monitoring the behaviour of a household's occupants through the use of additional sensors. However the costs and privacy concerns of such sensors have significantly limited their potential for widespread adoption. In contrast, in this paper we propose an approach which detects Activities of Daily Living, which we use as a proxy for the health of the household residents. Our approach detects appliance usage from existing smart meter data, from which the unique daily routines of the household occupants are learned automatically via a log Gaussian Cox process. We evaluate our approach using two real-world data sets, and show it is able to detect over 80% of kettle uses while generating less than 10% false positives. Furthermore, our approach allows earlier interventions in households with a consistent routine and fewer false alarms in the remaining households, relative to a fixed-time intervention benchmark.},

  abstract =  {Within the emerging new technologies in Smart Grids, the concern about Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) techniques has increased over the last five years. These techniques aim to disaggregate the energy consumption on a household or commercial building into individual appliances from the use of a single-point sensor. Most efforts attempt to disaggregate by using a low sampling frequency and by focusing on steady consumption states. Nevertheless, to achieve a better accuracy, it is necessary a higher sampling frequency and to look up both steady states and transient states. This paper proposes a novel event-based detector that could be used in NILM systems in a previous stage in order to detect transient states and help to the labelling task. This could lead to a better performance, specially taking into account small power changes which are not usually well detected on most low-frequency systems. It is based on the use of Hilbert Transform to obtain the envelope of the signal and the use of an average and a derivate filter to obtain a set of spikes that characterize each transition. The performance has been tested using a set of known metrics obtaining good results in two cases: sampling at 1kHz, which the aim of a possible integration in smart meters; and in a real scenario where 20 different appliance-loads are connected to the power main.},

  abstract =     {A detailed and on-line knowledge of the electrical load demand by the users is a critical issue for an effective and responsive deployment of home/building energy management. An approach based on the application of Non Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM) techniques copes with the goal of disaggregating composite loads; but to get a high level of precision, NIALM algorithms need a complete load signature and complex optimization algorithms to find the right combination of single loads that fits the real electrical measurements. On the other hand, it is practically impossible to get the detailed signature of all appliances inside a house/building and sophisticated optimization algorithm are not suitable for on-line applications. To overcome such problems a straightforward NIALM algorithm is proposed, it is based on both a simple load signature, rated active and reactive power and a heuristic disaggregation algorithm. Of course, it is expected that on real applications, this approach cannot reach very high performances; this is the reason why an active involvement of users is considered. The users’ feedback aims to: correct the load signatures, reduce the error of disaggregation algorithm and increase the active participation of users in saving energy politics. The NIALM algorithm has been accurately tested numerically using as input load curves generated randomly but under given constraints. In this way, the causes of inefficiency of the proposed approach are quantitatively analyzed both separately and in different combinations. Finally, the increase of the efficiency of the NIALM algorithm due to the application of different feedback actions is evaluated and discussed.},

  abstract =    {There is a growing trend in monitoring residential infrastructures to provide inhabitants with more information about their energy consumption and help them to reduce usage and cost. Device-level power consumption information, while a functionality in newer smart appliances, is not generally available to consumers. In electricity consumption disaggregation, Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to methods that provide consumers estimates of device-level energy consumption based on aggregate measurements usually taken at the main circuit panel or electric meter. The traditional NILM approach characterizes changes in the power signal when devices turn on or o, and it infers the consumption of different devices present in the home based on these changes. Generally, these NILM methods require training and models of the devices present in the home in order to function properly. Because of these challenges, much of the NILM literature does not address the actual energy disaggregation problem but focuses on detecting events and classifying changes in power. In this dissertation, we propose a relaxation to the traditional NILM problem and provide an unsupervised, data-driven algorithm to solve it. Specifically we propose Power Consumption Clustered Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (PCC-NILM), a relaxation that reports on the energy usage of devices grouped together by power consumption levels. In order to solve the PCC-NILM problem, we provide the Approximate Power Trace Decomposition Algorithm (APTDA). Unlike other methods, APTDA does not require training and it provides estimated energy consumption for different classes of devices.},

The study recruited a total of 38 participants to five demographically differentiated focus groups, each of
which met twice. At the first meeting, each group designed an ideal home energy display based on
participants’ ideas of what they thought such a display ought to include. Participants then spent a week
using existing models at home. At the second meeting, the groups reviewed their experience and revised
their designs accordingly. The study found remarkable convergence in the groups’ final designs, enabling
the clear specification of a core set of features and functionality for home energy displays.

Only one of the displays used in the study, the GEO minim, comes close to meeting this specification.
Despite a relatively well developed display industry in the UK, the majority of the home energy displays
currently on the market do not have the functionality that consumers identify, in practice, as being critical
to display design. Hence ‘the market’ cannot be relied on to deliver an outcome that is optimal for
consumers.},

Second, billions of dollars are being spent to install smart meters, yet the energy saving and financial benefits of this infrastructure – without careful consideration of the human element – will not reach its full potential. We believe that we can address these problems by strategically marrying them, using disaggregation. Disaggregation refers to a set of statistical approaches for extracting end-use and/or appliance level data from an aggregate, or whole-building, energy signal. In this paper, we explain how appliance level data affords numerous benefits, and why using the algorithms in conjunction with smart meters is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for getting this data. We review disaggregation algorithms and their requirements, and evaluate the extent to which smart meters can meet those requirements.

  abstract =  {Recent weeks have seen a political furore around the future of so-called “green levies” on energy bills,
including the ECO. The current debate is largely ill-informed and driven by energy suppliers with a
vested interest in removing obligations that compel them to help their customers save energy. This
briefing pack provides a series of arguments, backed up by evidence, that show why it is necessary to
retain and improve the ECO. First, energy efficiency is the best way to prevent bills spiralling out of
control. Comparing a range of policy options shows that installing energy efficiency measures could
save a typical household over £500 each year, compared to the temporary £72 a year promised by Ed
Miliband through a price freeze, and the meagre £2.44 offered by the government’s tariff reform.
Scrapping the ECO, meanwhile, would only save £47 on a typical annual duel fuel bill.
Furthermore, the UK is currently one of the worst countries in Europe for energy efficiency. We
can learn from cases of best practice such as Sweden, which show that improving the UK’s housing
stock would bring major benefits to householders, making energy bills more affordable and creating
warmer, healthier homes. In the UK, there are still very significant opportunities for the
installation of measures. Our review of remaining potential shows that opportunities for measures
are certainly not a barrier to wide-scale and cost-effective energy efficiency schemes – contrary to some
DECC statements. While past ECO-type schemes have been running successfully for 20 years, and have
helped around half of UK homes, it is now essential to finish the job, and ensure that all homes are
protected from rising gas and electricity prices. Cutting the ECO now would be deeply unfair to these
people who have not yet received help.
Some might argue that while promoting energy efficiency is important, the ECO is not the best way to
achieve this. However, the ECO is currently the only realistic policy option for promoting energy
efficiency across Great Britain. DECC’s latest figures show that to the end of September 2013, 98% of 
all measures delivered through energy efficiency policies were delivered by the ECO1. While publicly
funded schemes are also valuable (alongside supplier obligations like the ECO), these schemes often
experience fluctuations in funding year-by-year, creating a climate of uncertainty for the industry. A
publicly-funded grant scheme, Warm Front, was recently scrapped and a new scheme of this kind is
highly improbable in the near future. Therefore, the idea of funding the ECO through general taxation is
a red herring, and may be being used by energy companies as a cover for lobbying against the ECO.
We also show that the ECO is essential in tackling fuel poverty. Making homes highly energy
efficient is by far the best solution to end fuel poverty. Policies promoting energy efficiency will mean
that, in 2015, the average annual bill for a low income household will be £73 lower than it would be
without the policies. These savings become greater in succeeding years. However, current spending to
tackle fuel poverty through energy efficiency, even before cutbacks to the ECO are contemplated, is only
one eighth of what it needs to be to effectively deal with the problem. Given that the Prime Minister
wrote personally to the chairman of the government’s Fuel Poverty Advisory Group in January2 to
reaffirm his commitment to ending fuel poverty in England by 2016, it is incumbent on him to
strengthen, not weaken the ECO.
In addition, we show that cutting or scrapping the ECO would have disastrous consequences for
employment. Scrapping the ECO would result in the loss of 32,000 jobs in 2014 and would have a
disastrous effect on investor confidence. A range of business and industry representatives have written
to the government to express grave concerns over the current climate of uncertainty, and to call for the
ECO to be retained and improved. We show that the ECO can be improved through a combination of
simple cost-cutting changes and a refocusing on lower cost insulation measures. Specifically, the
ECO should be improved through these simple cost-cutting measures:
 Take carry-over from CERT into account in total cost expectations
 ‘Deemed savings’ to reduce risk and simplify customer proposition
 Price cap on Hard to Treat Cavities in ECO CERO (to stop windfalls)
 Price cap on ECO CERO (to make up for market failure)
 Introduce a solid wall insulation minimum target into ECO and increase Government cashback
for solid wall insulations to avoid ECO paying for supply chain development
Crucially, this should be combined with a change in parameters to refocus the ECO onto lower cost
insulation improvements. This will ensure we can meet the ECO’s goals and support insulation
industry jobs whilst reducing uncertainty in the cost of delivery. Taken in combination, these
improvements offer a realistic way to maintain and develop the ECO, while minimising costs.
These evidence-based arguments combine to present a clear conclusion: the ECO has a vital role to play
in reducing energy bills, tackling fuel poverty and building a strong and sustainable energy efficiency
sector. Now more than ever, the government must maintain a consistent and ambitious energy
efficiency obligation on suppliers, in order to protect consumers from price rises and ensure the UK’s
future prosperity and wellbeing.

  abstract =     {Energy modeling is globally used during the design phase to estimate future building energy performance. Predictions obtained from common energy estimation software typically deviate from actual energy consumption levels. This discrepancy can mainly be attributed to the misrepresentation of the role that building occupants play in the energy estimation equation. Although occupants might have different and varying energy use characteristics over time, current energy estimation tools assume they are constant. This paper proposes a new agent-based approach to commercial building energy modeling by accounting for the diverse and dynamic energy consumption patterns among occupants, in addition to the potential changes in their energy use behavior attributable to their interactions with the building environment and with each other. The impact of an active modeling of occupancy is then illustrated in a case study of an office in a university building, where more than 25% variation in the predicted energy consumption was obtained when using the proposed method versus a traditional commonly used method with static occupancy parameters.},

Three common strategies for generating energy consumption data, i.e., measurement, survey, and simulation, are described. A number of important characteristics pertaining to each strategy and the resulting data sets are discussed. In addition, a directory of energy consumption data sets of buildings is developed. The data sets are collected from either published papers or energy related organisations.

The energy disaggregation of smart meter data provides accurate information regarding the electricity consumption but also reveals detailed information pertaining to the customer. Load signatures-that is unique for every appliance can be used to declare the behavioral pattern of the customers such as their sleep-wake cycles, usage period of various appliances, time during which the house is empty and by far, which particular channel is being viewed on the television. The smart meter data is transmitted to the utility company at regular intervals of time over the internet. Data that has such potential to access private information can be tampered with, by an undesirable third party during transmission. This is a vital privacy threat to the customer and has hyped the researches pertaining to smart meter data security in the recent times. To assure security, we introduce an algorithm that aims at encryption of data prior to transmission. The algorithm employs the FFT algorithm and various nonlinear systems to generate chaotic signals. The obtained chaotic signal is amalgamated with a transformed version of the smart meter data and securely transmitted over a suitable network. The proposed algorithm is tested on a real household's power signal data.},

To optimize the energy consumption, the behavior of occupants must be changed. This can be achieved by providing information and suggestions to occupants. A first step is developing of a less expensive and non-invasive measurement system and metering of the electricity and heat consumed. Based on collected experimental data, it can identify the parameters of a thermal model of the house. The model obtained will be used to simulate different aspects that can help to reduce the energy consumption. This paper presents a simple solution for thermal modeling of a house which includes experimental identification of the model's parameters. Such data are used to simulate the thermal behavior of the house and to obtain solutions to reduce energy consumption. In simulation, the control of the thermal system is performed using a model based predictive control algorithm.},

  abstract =    {The proliferation of smart meter deployments has led to significant interest in
analyzing home energy use as part of the emerging ‘smart grid’. As buildings account
for nearly 40% of society’s energy use, data from smart meters provides significant
opportunities for both utilities and consumers to optimize energy use, minimize waste,
and provide insight into how modern homes and devices use energy. Meter data is
often difficult to analyze, however, owing to the aggregation of many disparate and
complex loads as well as relatively coarse measurement granularities. At utility scales,
analysis is further complicated by the vast quantity of data, which precludes the use
of computationally intensive techniques when monitoring hundreds or even thousands
of homes.
In this thesis, I present an architecture for enabling smart homes using smart
energy meters, encompassing efficient data collection and analysis to understand the
behavior of home devices. I consider four primary challenges within this domain: (1)
providing low-overhead data collection and processing for many devices, (2) designing
models characterizing the energy use of modern devices, (3) using these models to
track the real-time behavior of known devices, and (4) automatic identification of
unknown devices in the home.
To enable practical smart homes, my proposed architecture combines low-cost, off-
the-shelf sensing equipment with a hybrid local and cloud-based processing backend.
To analyze data within the environment, I first characterize the basic device types
present in today’s homes (e.g., resistive, inductive, or non-linear) and distill the essential
usage characteristics of each type. Using these characteristics, I construct a set
of models that more accurately represents real-world devices than previous simplistic
models. I then leverage this modeling framework to track the behavior of specific devices,
using a technique that runs in close to real-time and can scale to many devices.
Finally, I present a technique to automatically identify unknown devices attached to
smart outlets in homes, which relieves homeowners of the need to manually describe
devices in order to employ smart home optimizations.},

result, the basic NILM problem and its primary application—
a simple appliance-level breakdown of home energy usage—has
remained unchanged since its inception. We believe a renewed
focus on NILM applications could help steer future research in
novel directions by exposing new problem variants, data analysis
techniques, and evaluation metrics. In this paper, we summarize
our own application-centric research agenda, which focuses on
online applications that generate results in real time as smart

led us to consider efficiency and performance issues not addressed

The problem is important, since many energy optimizations require fine-grained, per-load energy data in real time; it also differs from the well-studied problem of load disaggregation in that it emphasizes efficient, online operation and per-load accuracy, rather than accurate disaggregation of every building load via offline analysis. In essence, tracking a particular load creates a virtual power meter for it, which mimics having a networked-connected power meter attached to it. To enable high performance, we take a model-driven approach that focuses on efficiently detecting a small number of identifiable load features in smart meter data. Our results demonstrate that our system, called PowerPlay, i) enables efficient online tracking on low-power embedded platforms, ii) scales to thousands of loads (across many buildings) on server platforms, and iii) improves per-load accuracy by more than a factor of two compared to a state-of-the-art load disaggregation algorithm.},

Our data captures many important aspects of the home environment, including average household electricity usage every second, as well as usage at every circuit and nearly every plug load, electricity generation data from on-site solar panels and wind turbines, outdoor weather data, temperature and humidity data in indoor rooms, and, finally, data for a range of important binary events, e.g., at wall switches, the HVAC system, doors, and from motion sensors. We also have electricity usage data every minute from 400 anonymous homes. This data corpus has served as the foundation for much of our recent research.

  abstract =  {Flattening household electricity demand reduces generation costs, since costs are disproportionately affected by peak demands. While the vast majority of household electrical loads are interactive and have little scheduling flexibility (TVs, microwaves, etc.), a substantial fraction of home energy use derives from background loads with some, albeit limited, flexibility. Examples of such devices include A/Cs, refrigerators, and dehumidifiers. In this paper, we study the extent to which a home is able to transparently flatten its electricity demand by scheduling only background loads with such flexibility. We propose a Least Slack First (LSF) scheduling algorithm for household loads, inspired by the well-known Earliest Deadline First algorithm. We then integrate the algorithm into Smart-Cap, a system we have built for monitoring and controlling electric loads in homes. To evaluate LSF, we collected power data at outlets, panels, and switches from a real home for 82 days. We use this data to drive simulations, as well as experiment with a real testbed implementation that uses similar background loads as our home. Our results indicate that LSF is most useful during peak usage periods that exhibit “peaky” behavior, where power deviates frequently and significantly from the average. For example, LSF decreases the average deviation from the mean power by over 20% across all 4-hour periods where the deviation is at least 400 watts.},

If these trends continue, new buildings in the near future will be able to install “smart” outlets, which monitor and transmit an outlets power usage in real time, for nearly the same cost as conventional outlets. One problem with the pervasive deployment of smart outlets is that users must currently identify the specific device plugged into each meter, and then manually update the outlets meta-data in software whenever a new device is plugged into the outlet. Correct meta-data is important in both interpreting historical outlet energy data and using the data for building management. To address this problem, we propose Non-Intrusive Load Identification (NILI), which automatically identifies the device attached to a smart outlet without any human intervention. In particular, in our approach to NILI, we identify an intuitive and simple-to-compute set of features from time-series energy data and then employ well-known classifiers. Our results achieve accuracy of over 90% across 15 device types on outlet-level energy traces collected from multiple real homes.},

With an increasingly ageing population, the awareness and views of older people on energy use, technology, smart meters, smart grids are becoming progressively more important. Their behaviours regarding energy and technology use differ from the majority as they are usually living on low incomes and are at risk of fuel poverty. It is therefore important to understand their acceptance, engagement or resistance to smart metering, IHDs and external control of home appliances and heating. Their willingness and capacity to change time-use behaviours and reduce consumption is crucial. A study of older tenants in rural Scotland is presented. Sensors and IHDs were installed to measure and display electricity costs and consumption of large appliances and the electricity supply for each house, and show internal household and external temperatures. Householder’s use of energy, habits and routine, strategies for keeping warm and attitudes towards technology, smart metering, IHDs and direct external control of appliances and heating were explored through interviews.

  abstract =  {The need for energy disaggregation increases with
the need for a more detailed understanding and more accurate
estimates about the energy usage. One of the main approaches for
energy disaggregation is Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM).
NILM refers to the analysis of the aggregate power consumption
of electric loads in order to recognize the existence and the
consumption profile of each individual appliance. While there
exist non event-based NILM systems, many NILM systems follow
the event-based approach in the sense that they rely mainly on the
detection and classification of events in the aggregate electrical
signal. In this paper, we describe our work on developing an
event detector suitable for unsupervised NILM systems. The
proposed event detector is capable of accurately defining the
times limits of each transition interval in the power signal. This
feature is very important specially for NILM systems that depend
on transient features. The detector is tested on the publicly
available BLUED dataset and shows event detection results more
than 98%. Test results of a complete unsupervised NILM system
using the proposed detector are also provided and show possible
disaggregation up to 92% of the energy. Moreover, the system
has been utilized in an energy-disaggregation competition held

In our first work we present techniques for actionable feedback across fridges and air conditioning (HVAC) units, which can save upto 25% of fridge energy and identify homes needing feedback on HVAC setpoint schedule with 84% accuracy. In our next work, we do an extensive sensor deployment in a home in Delhi, India; monitoring appliance level power, home aggregate power and other ambient parameters. Our study presents various insights unseen in the developed world, such as: frequent voltage brownouts, poor network reliability, long lasting blackouts, heavy dominance of fridge and HVAC to overall energy consumption. Our study verifies that measuring appliance level power scales poorly in cost and maintenance. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is viewed as a viable alternative where machine learning techniques are used to break down aggregate household energy consumption into contributing appliances. Despite the existence of a rich volume of literature in NILM, it remained virtually impossible to compare NILM works due to: i) lack of existence of benchmarks; ii) previous work tested on single data set; iii) inconsistent metrics. To address these challenges we developed an open source toolkit: Non-intrusive load monitoring toolkit (NILMTK), designed specifically to enable the comparison of NILM algorithms. While many new NILM techniques have been proposed in recent times, it is not clear if these can enable energy saving and whether higher accuracy translates to higher energy saving. We explore these questions in our recent work and find that existing energy disaggregation techniques do not provide power traces with sufficient fidelity to support the feedback techniques we developed in our earlier work. Our results indicate a need to revisit the metrics by which disaggregation is evaluated.},

Dominant electricity consumption within the buildings, contributed by plug loads, lighting and air conditioning, can be significantly improved using Occupancy-based Building Management Systems (Ob-BMS).

We present key learning across these three aspects evolved over more than one year of design and deployment experiences. The sensor node design evolved over a period of time to address specific deployment requirements. With an opportunity at the host institute where two dorm buildings were getting constructed, we planned for the support infrastructure required for fine resolution monitoring embedded in the design phase and share our preliminary experiences and key learning thereof. Prototype deployment of the sensing system as per the planned support infrastructure was performed at two faculty offices with effective data collection worth 45 days. Collected data is analyzed accounting for efficient switching of appliances, in addition to energy conservation and user comfort as performed in the earlier occupancy based frameworks. Our analysis shows that occupancy prediction using simple heuristic based modeling can achieve similar performance as more complex Hidden Markov Models, thus simplifying the analytic framework.},

We present novel techniques that use unsupervised energy disaggregation to predict both household occupancy and static properties of the household such as size of the home and number of occupants. Results show that basic disaggregation approaches performs up to 30% better at occupancy estimation than using aggregate power data alone, and are up to 10% better at estimating static household characteristics. These results show that even rudimentary energy disaggregation techniques are sufficient for improved inference of household characteristics.

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), i.e. the process of disaggregating the overall home electricity usage measured at the meter level into constituent appliances, provides a simple and cost effective methodology to provide such feedback to the occupants. In this paper we present Improved Non-Intrusive load monitoring using load Division and Calibration (INDiC) that simplifies NILM by dividing the appliances across multiple instrumented points (meters/phases) and calibrating the measured power. Proposed approach is used together with the Combinatorial Optimization framework and evaluated on the popular REDD dataset.

More than three decades of work in NILM has resulted in the development of several novel algorithmic approaches. However, despite these advancements, two core challenges still exist: i) disaggregating low power consumption appliances and ii) distinguishing between multiple instances of similar appliances. These challenges are becoming increasingly important due to an increasing number of appliances and increased usage of electronics in homes. Previous approaches have attempted to solve these problems using expensive hardware involving high sampling rates better suited to laboratory settings, or using additional number of sensors, limiting the ease of deployment. In this work, we explore using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) power line communication (PLC) modems as an inexpensive and easy to deploy alternative solution to these problems. We use the reduction in bandwidth between two PLC modems, caused due to the change in PLC modulation scheme when different appliances are operated as a signature for an appliance. Since the noise generated in the powerline is dependent both on type and location of an appliance, we believe that our technique based on PLC modems can be a promising addition for solving NILM.},

Real deployments, and collected data thereof, play a critical role in providing insights into home energy consumption and occupant behavior. Existing datasets from real residential deployments are all from the developed countries. Developing countries, such as India, present unique opportunities to evaluate the scalability of existing research in diverse settings. Building upon more than a year of experience in sensor network deployments, we undertake an extensive deployment in a three storey home in Delhi, spanning 73 days from May-August 2013, measuring electrical, water and ambient parameters. We used 33 sensors across the home, measuring these parameters, collecting a total of approx. 400 MB of data daily. We discuss the architectural implications on the deployment systems that can be used for monitoring and control in the context of developing countries. Addressing the unreliability of electrical grid and internet in such settings, we present Sense Local-store Upload architecture for robust data collection. While providing several unique aspects, our deployment further validates the common considerations from similar residential deployments, discussed previously in the literature. We also release our collected data- Indian data for Ambient Water and Electricity Sensing (iAWE), for public use.},

In recent years, the field has rapidly expanded due to increased interest as national deployments of smart meters have begun in many countries. However, empirically comparing disaggregation algorithms is currently virtually impossible. This is due to the different data sets used, the lack of reference implementations of these algorithms and the variety of accuracy metrics employed. To address this challenge, we present the Non-intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit (NILMTK); an open source toolkit designed specifically to enable the comparison of energy disaggregation algorithms in a reproducible manner. This work is the first research to compare multiple disaggregation approaches across multiple publicly available data sets. Our toolkit includes parsers for a range of existing data sets, a collection of preprocessing algorithms, a set of statistics for describing data sets, two reference benchmark disaggregation algorithms and a suite of accuracy metrics. We demonstrate the range of reproducible analyses which are made possible by our toolkit, including the analysis of six publicly available data sets and the evaluation of both benchmark disaggregation algorithms across such data sets.},

  abstract =     {Non intrusive load monitoring (NILM), or energy disaggregation, is the process of separating the total electricity consumption of a building as measured at single point into the building's constituent loads. Previous research in the field has mostly focused on residential buildings, and although the potential benefits of applying this technology to commercial buildings have been recognised since the field's conception, NILM in the commercial domain has been largely unexplored by the academic community. As a result of the heterogeneity of this section of the building stock (i.e., encompassing buildings as diverse as airports, malls and coffee shops), and hence the loads within them, many of the solutions developed for residential energy disaggregation do not apply directly. In this paper we highlight some insights for NILM in the commercial domain using data collected from a large smart meter deployment within an educational campus in Delhi, India, of which a subset of the data has been released for public use. We present an empirical characterisation of loads in commercial buildings, highlighting the differences in energy consumption and load characteristics between residential and commercial buildings. We assess the validity of the assumptions generally made by NILM solutions for residential buildings when applied to measurements from commercial facilities. Based on our observations, we discuss the required traits for a NILM system for commercial buildings, and run benchmark residential NILM algorithms on our data set to confirm our observations. To advance the research in commercial buildings energy disaggregation, we release a subset of our data set, called COMBED (commercial building energy data set).},

  abstract =     {In this paper, we investigate whether "big-data" is more valuable than "precise" data for the problem of energy disaggregation: the process of breaking down aggregate energy usage on a per-appliance basis. Existing techniques for disaggregation rely on energy metering at a resolution of 1 minute or higher, but most power meters today only provide a reading once per month, and at most once every 15 minutes. In this paper, we propose a new technique called Neighbourhood NILM that leverages data from 'neighbouring' homes to disaggregate energy given only a single energy reading per month. The key intuition behind our approach is that 'similar' homes have 'similar' energy consumption on a per-appliance basis. Neighbourhood NILM matches every home with a set of 'neighbours' that have direct submetering infrastructure, i.e. power meters on individual circuits or loads. Many such homes already exist. Then, it estimates the appliance-level energy consumption of the target home to be the average of its K neighbours. We evaluate this approach using 25 homes and results show that our approach gives comparable or better disaggregation in comparison to state-of-the-art accuracy reported in the literature that depend on manual model training, high frequency power metering, or both. Results show that Neighbourhood NILM can achieve 83% and 79% accuracy disaggregating fridge and heating/cooling loads, compared to 74% and 73% for a technique called FHMM. Furthermore, it achieves up to 64% accuracy on washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, and lighting loads, which is higher than previously reported results. Many existing techniques are not able to disaggregate these loads at all. These results indicate a potentially substantial advantage to installing submetering infrastructure in a select few homes rather than installing new high-frequency smart metering infrastructure in all homes.},

We evaluate these techniques using power traces from 240 homes and find that they can detect homes that need feedback with as much as 84% accuracy. Second, we evaluate whether existing energy disaggregation techniques provide power traces with sufficient fidelity to support the feedback techniques that we created and whether more accurate disaggregation results translate into more energy savings for the users. Results show that feedback accuracy is very low even while disaggregation accuracy is high. These results indicate a need to revisit the metrics by which disaggregation is evaluated.},

only the monthly energy bill and household characteristics

indicate that the accuracy of Gemello is comparable to or

better than existing techniques that use sensing infrastruc-

but only if the 'neighbours' selected by KNN are actually geographically close (in the same city)?  Supposedly, depending on your dataset and the features you select, KNN could pick 'neighbours' which are in different countries (but have similar number of occupants, demographics etc.)?

"the monthly energy consumption
is often dominated by heating/cooling loads"

not in the UK (and most of Europe, I suspect).  The UK uses natural gas for heating.  And we have very little A/C in domestic dwellings.

But France uses a lot of elec for heating (using night storage heaters)

"Static household characteristics such as area, number of occupants"

 number of occupants isn't necessarily static (our house has gone from having 2 occupants to having 4 occupants!)  And our pattern of energy usage has changed dramatically since having kids!  I'd think that identifying which homes have young kids would be a very informative feature for deciding on similarity!

Limitations: I would suggest that a limitation of N-NILM is that - if I've understood correctly - it cannot find appliances which are anomalous.  i.e. one of the most convincing use-cases for NILM is to be able to identify appliances or behaviours which are consuming way more energy than the average (e.g. "your fridge is using 30% more than the average; perhaps check your door seal" or "your water heater is on constantly: check the thermostat").

Also, as you hint to in "limitation 3", N-NILM cannot track changes (either up or down) in energy demand for a specific house.  Again, I find this to be a convincing use-case for NILM: i.e. using NILM to answer the question "did the intervention actually result in a reduction in energy demand?"

Confusions left in my mind after reading the paper

I think you do touch on these things during your paper but it might be worth emphasising / repeating them!  Basically, I'm a little confused about exactly what the input to your algorithm is at test time.  Do you give the algorithm only the aggregate data for the test home?  Or do you also provide some metadata about the home (number of occupants etc?)  Or are all those features inferred from the aggregate data?  I assume they are inferred?   Also, do you need to give the algorithm a list of appliances in the test home?  If not, is there a reasonably high risk that N-NILM will make mistakes when it lists the appliances in the test home (e.g. it will either leave off some appliances or will include appliances which aren't in the test home) - and it's these sort of errors which would be very easy for users to pick up on and complain about!},

Urban metabolism analysis for any given time period can be challenging due to the lack of metropolitan- or city-level data, and reconstructing a time series of urban energy or material flows is seldom attempted. For the case of Melbourne, Australia, we demonstrate how time series operational energy demand and supply data can be reconstructed from original sources. Primary energy consumption is calculated based on direct and upstream energy use in common with “scope 2” standards for emissions reporting. This extends the usual treatment of energy in urban metabolism studies by (1) providing time series data and (2) attributing upstream primary energy consumption to sectors based on their direct secondary energy usage. Results indicate that the transport, commercial, manufacturing, and residential sectors have contributed most to the doubling of Melbourne's energy consumption over four decades. We discuss recent urban development history and its relation to energy consumption and briefly examine potential scenarios of and responses to future change.},

  abstract =  {A computer programme which aims to cut power wastage in low-income households has been launched after a trial in five east London boroughs.

The Shimmer system assesses a home's electricity consumption and recommends ways to make it more efficient, the Energy Saving Trust said.

It also connects to an online accounting tool to encourage budgeting.

The project could "help a lot of people in future", said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice.

Last week an independent report found thousands of people die each year from illnesses linked to fuel poverty.

Shimmer works by connecting electrical appliances to "smart" plugs which measure the amount of power used and provide an itemised bill showing how much each item costs to run.

The programme then suggests how to cut costs, for instance by recommending more efficient boilers or fridges, and lists appropriate benefits and allowances available to the user.
'Smart homes'

A total of 18 homes, most of which were in debt and had little disposable income, tried the system in Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge and Waltham Forest.

The savings for each ran into hundreds of pounds a year, the trust said.

"Ultimately, we need to have smart homes, not just smart meters," said chief executive Philip Sellwood.

Citizens Advice said increasing numbers of people were seeking information on cutting fuel bills and saving energy.

"Around Â£18bn of means-tested benefits and tax credits is unclaimed this year and this project shows that some of the biggest 'savings' for households came as a result of advice on financial issues and benefit entitlements people either did not know about, or did not think were for them," said Ms Guy.

"Combining that advice with new technology which puts customers in control of their energy usage could be a powerful combination to help a lot of people in future."},

On the other hand, most applications of appliance load monitoring (signal analysis) refer to the energy saving and the costs reducing of energy consumption. Consequently, our proposal constitutes an original application and new algorithmic method based on steady-state operations and signatures. The extraction process of load signatures of appliances is carried out in a three-dimensional space through a single power analyzer, which is non-intrusive (NIALM). We have rigorously tested this new approach by conducting an experiment in our smart home prototype by simulating daily scenarios taken from clinical trials previously done with Alzheimer patients. The promising results we obtained are presented and compared to other approaches, showing that, with an exceptionally minimal investment and the exploitation of relatively limited data, our method can efficiently recognize activities of daily living for providing assistive services.},

These devices are robust, cheap, accessible, connected to the Internet, etc. With the growing needs in terms of human and medical resources to help cognitively-impaired people to remain at home, researchers are investing in new ways to exploit this technology with artificial intelligence, in order to build expert systems to assist the residents in their daily activities. Several systems have been proposed in the last few years, mostly based on binary sensors, cameras and other sensors such as Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. Cameras are very intrusive, binary sensors (such as movement detectors) give only basic information, and other types of sensors (such as RFID) need complex deployment. In this context, this paper presents a new assistive expert system based on electric device identification to address the problem of guidance and supervision in the performance of activities for people with cognitive disorders living in a smart home. This system is solely based on a single power analyzer placed in the electric panel. We propose an algorithmic approach used to recognize erratic behaviors related to cognitive deficits and provides cues to guide the person in the completion of an ongoing task. This is achieved through load signatures study of appliances represented by three features (active power (P), reactive power (Q) and line-to-neutral), which allows to determine the errors committed by the resident. We implemented this system within a genuine smart-home prototype equipped with household appliances used by the patient during his morning routines. Different multimedia prompting devices (iPad, screen, speakers, etc.) were used. We tested the system with real-case scenarios modeled from former clinical trials, allowing demonstration of accuracy and effectiveness of our system in assisting a cognitively-impaired resident in the completion of daily activities.

Highlights
• We present an assistive system for guiding cognitively-impaired people in performing daily activities.
• The system is based on electrical signal analysis with a single sensor.
• The system is able to detect cognitive errors and send prompts accordingly.
• The system has been implemented, deployed and tested in real home environment.
• The simulation of real-case scenarios has shown promising results.},

  abstract =   {Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},

While hardware-based sub-metering is costly and labor-intensive, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is capable of gathering detailed energy-use data with minimal equipment cost and installation time. However, variations in measurements between metering devices complicate the process of compiling the necessary appliance profiles.

There are a small number of commercially available systems that implement NILM, albeit marketed for utilities as a tool for performing load research. As a proof of concept, and in order to obtain preliminary data that would help us evaluate the feasibility of using NILM to support electricity audits in a residential building, we decided to focus our attention on one of the top residential loads: the refrigerator. We installed a NILM prototype system in an apartment building, and a plug-level power meter was used to accurately track the individual consumption of this appliance. The experiment consisted in monitoring this load for a week, using the two methodologies (NILM and pluglevel meters), and then comparing the estimated energy consumption as computed by each.},

  abstract =    {Energy services play a growing role in the control of energy consumption and the improvement of energy efficiency in non-residential buildings. Most of the energy use analyses involved in the energy efficiency service process require on-field measurements and energy use analysis. Today, while detailed on-field measurements and energy counting stay generally expensive and time-consuming, energy simulations are increasingly cheaper due to the continuous improvement of computer speed. This work consists in the development of a simulation-based approach dedicated to whole-building energy use analysis for use in the frame of an energy efficiency service process. Focus is given to the development of a new simplified dynamic hourly building energy simulation tool adapted to energy use analysis of existing buildings, its calibration by means of available energy use data and to the integration of the calibration process into the Energy Service Process. The proposed evidence-based calibration methodology is deeply related to on-field inspection and data collection issues and is developed to fit with the audit/inspection process. After calibration, the model can be used to support the other steps of the Energy Services Process, such as ECOs selection and evaluation and continuous performance verification. The new systematic calibration methodology gives priority to the physical identification of the model’s parameters (i.e. to the direct measurement) and relies on the notion of hierarchy among the source of information (as a function of their reliability) used to identify the value of the parameters. The improved Morris’ sensitivity analysis method is used for “factor fixing” (i.e. distinction between non-influential model’s parameters) and “parameters screening” (i.e. classification of influential parameters by order of importance) in order to orient the data collection work and guide the parameters adjustment process. At the end of the calibration process, the Latin Hypercube Monte Carlo sampling is used to quantify the uncertainty on the final outputs of the calibrated model. The developed simulation tool and the associated calibration method are applied to a synthetic case (“Virtual Calibration Test Bed”) and to real case study building located in Brussels, Belgium. Both applications (real and synthetic cases) allow highlighting the complexity and the limits of calibration as it is used today. Calibration remains a highly underdetermined problem and a compromise has to be found between data collection and modeling efforts and model’s requirements in order to proceed to efficient energy use analysis. At the end of these applications, it is believed that partially manual methods remain more efficient and the best quality assurance when proceeding to calibration of a building energy simulation model. The use of an evidence-based method ensures sticking to reality and avoids bad representation and hazardous adjustment of the parameters. Moreover, it is shown that the intensive use of a sensitivity analysis method is of a great help to orient data collection and parameters adjustment processes. Defining confidence/uncertainty ranges for each parameter, in addition to a “best-guess” value, also allowed quantifying the uncertainty on the final outputs of the model and helped the user in evaluating the quality of the calibrated model.},

Bidgely HomeBeat Web & Mobile was deployed to the pilot group to facilitate engagement with PG&E beyond the utility’s existing customer portal. Connected to an in-home ZigBee-based energy monitor, the Bidgely solution offered a personalized view of home energy usage and cost down to the appliance level.

  review =    {On 10th Feb 2016, I asked these questions on Bidgely's blog:

Did the trial have a control group who did not receive disaggregated energy data? Or did all 850 users receive disaggregated data?

The trial ran from August to December. In the absence of any intervention, would we expect to see a reduction in energy use over that time period in San Francisco due to, for example, a reduction in the requirement for air conditioning? (Although, according to WikiPedia*, the average high temperature is only 20.1°C in August and 13.9°C in December in San Fran, so maybe we'd actually expect an *increase* in energy demand in the absence of any intervention?!) Did the study factor out seasonal effects?

Do you have a more detailed report available, please?

Some other things to mention about this trial:

* not peer reviewed?
* Bidgely have a commercial interest, of course (that doesn't make the trial wrong, of course)
* is 5 months (the trial duration) too short to see a rebound effect?},

  abstract =    {The need to achieve a transition to a low carbon economy has renewed interest in "energy efficiency" and what has become known as "demand side management". This thesis investigates the role of measurement and modelling in the management of domestic electricity demand. Practice and policy have, since the 1950s, tended to favour a "supply paradigm" centred on the imperative of increasing energy supply. Despite the upheaval of market liberalisation, and twenty years of climate change debate, the domestic electricity "culture" has changed very little. The first half of this thesis contributes to this subject by describing the complex development of the electricity system that we are familiar with today. Drawing upon technical, social and political themes, the current and emerging practices of measurement, modelling, and management are critiqued. It is argued that current practices require revaluation, if alternative, decentralised approaches are to receive a fair analysis. The thesis contributes in empirical terms by extending the evidence base and developing modelling tools for the analysis of domestic electricity use. Field data collected by the author concerning the power flow characteristics of domestic appliances are presented which identify the dynamic nature of domestic electrical loads. A modelling framework is then introduced that combines social and technical aspects of domestic energy demand, allowing synthesis of domestic load profiles and allowing comparison between localised interventions.},

We propose a method that can be applied to hourly whole-house electrical energy data to partially disaggregate total household electricity use into five load categories/parameters (base load, activity load, heating season gradient, cooling season gradient and lowest external temperature at which air-conditioning is used). This paper develops the proposed method, and verifies it using high-resolution end-use data from twelve households with known characteristics. We then apply the method to hourly whole-house (smart meter) data from 327 households in Ontario. The roll-out of smart (advanced) metering infrastructure in many countries will make hourly whole-house data abundant, and we propose that this method could be widely applied by utilities to target their demand-side management programs towards households more likely to provide benefits, thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of such programs.},

Pitfalls, sources of error in interpretation, and advantages and disadvantages of alternative procedures are laid out for demand estimators. The analysis demonstrates that estimates can be substantially different, depending on the choices the researcher makes among alternative statistical models, types of data, and estimation methods. After an introductory chapter, Chapter 2 presents the analytical basis for comparing and evaluating the econometric studies of energy demand. Starting from the economic concepts of demand common to these studies, the discussion focuses on the major methodological issues that arise in translating the theory into testable hypotheses about demand behavior. Chapters 3 through 6 discuss studies pertaining to electricity, natural gas, petroleum, and coal, according to consuming sector (residential, commercial, industrial, transportation, and electricity generation) and by modeling technique and type of data analyzed. This organization is intended to group the statistical results by common procedure and data in order to highlight their similarities and differences. The last chapter draws a number of conclusions about the empirical results and estimation methods reviewed. The conclusions about measures of price elasticity focus on the question of reliability and which measures may be regarded as most defensible.},

One of the hottest topic in this field is represented by Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM): it refers to those techniques aimed at decomposing the consumption aggregated data acquired at a single point of measurement into the diverse consumption profiles of appliances operating in the electrical system under study. The focus here is on unsupervised algorithms, which are the most interesting and of practical use in real case scenarios. Indeed, these methods rely on a sustainable amount of a-priori knowledge related to the applicative context of interest, thus minimizing the user intervention to operate, and are targeted to extract all information to operate directly from the measured aggregate data. This paper reports and describes the most promising unsupervised NILM methods recently proposed in the literature, by dividing them into two main categories: load classification and source separation approaches. An overview of the public available dataset used on purpose and a comparative analysis of the algorithms performance is provided, together with a discussion of challenges and future research directions.},

A simple identification algorithm has also been developed in order to estimate the signatures adequacy. Each appliance has been measured and classified as an individual load, using a simple identification procedure. Data obtained from two different measurement sets show that the proposed technique provides unique data formations for each appliance tested by developing an efficient recognition procedure with high levels of identification rate.

Two problems are examined. In the first problem the data is given in the traditional form of a string so the novel aspect is that insertions and deletions are now corrected. In the second problem, a unique string need not be given, but a regular language is given, and any string belonging to the regular language is a possible data string. Again, deletion addition, and changes of symbols are corrected. A direct generalization of the Viterbi decoding algorithm is thus proved to be an efficient technique for solving a much wider class of problems},

Consideration of economic welfare gains is provided.},

Participants (with the exception of the control group) received feedback in various forms, i.e. consumption compared to previous consumption or to similar others; energy saving tips in leaflets or on a computer; or feedback relating to financial or environmental costs. Respondents were interviewed after the start of the study to establish their income, socio-demographic status, environmental attitudes and the extent to which they already engaged in conserving activities. Participants also took part in focus groups after the final meter readings were taken. Overall the results indicated that income and demographic features predicted historic energy consumption but not changes in consumption during the field study, where environmental attitudes and feedback were influential. Of all the feedback groups, the installation of computers helped reduce consumption most markedly. Furthermore, people with positive environmental attitudes, but who had not previously been engaged in many conservation actions, were more likely to change their consumption subsequent to the feedback period. Recommendations are made both for energy conservation policy and future research.},

Given this, the present research used deliberative focus groups to examine what is needed to secure acceptance and engagement from domestic consumers with services, products and ‘offers’ in smarter power systems. Our findings suggest that consumers are able to identify not just threats relating to smart metering initiatives but opportunities as well. In particular, our focus group participants responded positively to the idea of an automated system that could be used to achieve energy savings in combination with time-of-use tariffs. We conclude by outlining suggestions for policy recommendations that may help consumer acceptance of smart meter enabled services be more readily achieved.

Highlights
• We examine consumer acceptance of smart metering initiatives using focus groups.
• Consumers perceive both threats and opportunities in smart metering initiatives.
• Threats include; autonomy issues, privacy concerns and mistrust of suppliers.
• Opportunities include: accurate billing and enablement of future ICT services.
• Consumers responded positively to the idea of automated energy management.},

  abstract =     {Hourly energy consumption data gathered from 94 (originally 160) low energy homes in Milton Keynes Energy Park (1989-1991). These homes were of conventional design for the UK (35 different designs) but included energy efficiency features (primarily increased insulation in the roof, wall, and flooring and energy efficient boilers) so that they correspond with SAP values of 75-90. The results were used to generate a database of energy consumption data to assist in development of the Building Research Establishment Domestic Energy Model (BREDEM).

This data was originally collected by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) during a project in 1988-91 in an area then known as Milton Keynes Energy Park, located some 75 km north-west of London. The study monitored more than 100 sites for hourly electricity and gas consumption; the dwellings essentially follow conventional UK housing design, but were built in 1987 to higher standards for energy performance than were required by the building regulations at that time (Edwards, 1990). They incorporated energy efficiency features, such as increased floor, wall, and loft insulation, double-glazing, and in some cases condensing boilers, so that they broadly corresponded to UK building standards of almost a decade later. 
The data has been rescued off the original 5.25 inch floppy disks by Steve Pretlove of UCL towards his PhD thesis and has since been cleaned and further processed by Alex Summerfield. Data were successfully retrieved for 94 sites with more than 200 days of valid date each. Some building data, including floor areas and U-values were recovered, unfortunately related social data, such as the number of occupants in each household, were not available.
Reference: J. Edwards (1990), Low energy dwellings in the Milton Keynes Energy Park, Energy Management v26 p32-33.
See also: numerous internal Buildings Research Establishment (BRE) reports.
Note that there are some missing data points largely due to problems of recovery from the original media (the data from July 1989 are missing from many data sets) but nonetheless there are many sites with > 12 months of data.},

  abstract =     {The energy savings potential within non-domestic buildings from behaviour change initiatives is well known. Energy efficiency measures can contribute to local, national and EU policy commitments on carbon reduction. Yet, research also shows behaviour change is anything but simple. No-where is this more evident that in local government where municipalities are expected to lead on carbon reduction initiatives whilst operating in challenging political landscapes. This paper reflects on a UK Research Council funded case study exploring the role of engagement in a UK municipality. Innovative feedback tools and user-engagement were developed in an effort to foster a collaborative approach to energy management.

Findings from an analysis of a focus group and a set of semi-structured interviews show encouraging signs with regard to increased user-engagement and digital tools, but barriers remain with regards to the ‘real world’ implementation of innovative, and technologically grounded, approaches. These included a staff reduction programme amidst financial cuts, a risk-averse culture with regard to new technologies, and debate about where responsibilities lie with regards to energy management. While these findings were case specific they have implications for organisations contemplating how technology might support them in workplace engagement for reduced energy use.},

These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks frorn data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented.

The main original contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms.},

This study was distinctive because it was accompanied by a weekly email communications programme and was provided within the context of community action.

We find that oceanic absorption of CO2 from fossil fuels may result in larger pH changes over the next several centuries than any inferred from the geological record of the past 300 million years, with the possible exception of those resulting from rare, extreme events such as bolide impacts or catastrophic methane hydrate degassing.},

Current solutions are too course-grained, too difficult to deploy, not networked, or offer poor coverage of hard to meter items, such as ceiling lights. To address these problems, we demonstrate a wirelessly networked, energy-harvesting power metering system that draws zero standby power and is power proportional to the load it is metering. The system is comprised of three different meters: one for plugged-in loads, one for panel-level circuits, and one for hard-to-sense loads, such as ceiling lights. Each meter harvests energy proportionally to the load it is measuring and powers a sensor node intermittently. Together, these sensors create multiple data streams which are aggregated by a receiver. When combined with a calibrated meter that measures total household power, our system can iteratively determine the contributions of each load to the total power usage, allowing users to gain a broad yet detailed view of their energy consumption and costs.},

Appliances usages should not be considered as independent events, but rather as enablers for activities. In this work, we propose an automated method for determining when an electrical device is triggered solely from its power trace. Knowing when an appliance is powered on is required for identifying recurrent patterns that could later be understood as activities. Leveraging activity knowledge over time will allow us to design personalized energy efficient measures. We envision the design of future ambient intelligence systems, where the smart home can optimize the energy consumption in regards to the lifestyles of its residents.},

With the emergence of technologies that provide detailed usage estimates for energy consumption, two questions arise. First, how many different energy-consuming appliances contribute to household electricity load, and secondly which appliances? Using national average penetration rates, the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), estimates that 42 unique appliances account for 93% of electricity consumption, while 12 appliances account for 80% of average household electric load. A typical scenario is developed from national and regional penetration rates and find that eight appliances are responsible for 80% of a household's electric load in the United States. Four household scenarios are developed: a house that uses electric appliances, gas appliances, the average household, and typical household. It is concluded that RECS cannot be used as a representative household as it overestimates the number of appliances that contribute to a household electric load. The number of significant appliances is affected by appliance ownership and use, which is more variable between homes than between census divisions. These results can be used to design and maximize the value of residential energy information and management systems.},

  abstract =  {This Recommendation sets out the general position on common spectrum allocations for Short Range Devices
(SRDs) for countries within the CEPT. It is also intended that it can be used as a reference document by the
CEPT member countries when preparing their national regulations in order to keep in line with the provisions
of the R&TTE Directive.
In using this Recommendation it should be remembered that it represents the most widely accepted position
within the CEPT but it should not be assumed that all allocations are available in all countries. An indication
of where allocations are not available or where deviations from the CEPT position occur is to be found in
Appendix 3.
It should also be remembered that the pattern of radio use is not static. It is continuously evolving to reflect the
many changes that are taking place in the radio environment; particularly in the field of technology. Spectrum
allocations must reflect these changes and the position set out in this Recommendation is therefore subject
to continuous review.
Moreover, many administrations have designated additional frequencies or frequency bands for SRD
applications on a national basis that do not conform to the CEPT position set out in this Recommendation.
For these reasons, those wishing to develop or market SRDs based on this Recommendation are advised
to contact the relevant national administration to verify that the position set out herein still applies. Any
inconsistencies between the national position stated in the implementation table in Appendix 1 of this
Recommendation and those national positions stated elsewhere should be brought to the attention of the ECO
(thomas.weber@eco.cept.org) in order that these differences may be resolved.
When selecting parameters for new SRDs, which may have inherent safety of human life implications,
manufacturers and users should pay particular attention to the potential for interference from other systems
operating in the same or adjacent},

This paper highlights results from two case studies conducted in real life – one in California and other international. The study in California, using an experimental design, shows a statistical proof of average 14% energy reduction in users exposed to Bidgely’s Energy Disaggregation-based solution with a maximum of 24% and a minimum of 3.5%. The international study shows high levels of consumer engagement, favorable consumer reaction and an 80% approval from users on making this solution available to all. These studies aim to support the introduction of
policies that open up real time data access from Smart Meters. Millions of these Smart Meters installed in field are already equipped with the right hardware but have not been enabled to deliver the above benefits.},

* They selected (cherry-picked?!) one month of data (Sept 2013) to show a difference between the control group and treatment groups.  But in Oct 2013 there is no difference between control and treatment groups (see fig 3).
* All participants were self-selecting (i.e. people signed themselves up to Bidgely).
* The control group isn't a real control group.    For example, if a user signs up in September 2013 then their previous three months of data (July, August, Sept) was used as the 'control' group to compare with people who had already signed up.  To quote their paper: "Instead of assigning users to a standalone control group, historical consumption data for treatment group was used as the control condition. For example, for users signing up and joining the treatment group in September, the previous 3 months of consumption data - July, August and September - was used as the control group data."
* They don't compare energy reductions *across time* (which is, ultimately, what we're interested in).  Instead they performed an absolute comparison between the treatment and control groups on a month-by-month basis.
* They assume the distributions of energy consumption are normally distributed but give no evidence to support this assumption (they don't even mention it).  Although apparently normality isn't essential, especially if N is big: http://thestatsgeek.com/2013/09/28/the-t-test-and-robustness-to-non-normality/

To compensate for the absence of classes, our system uses implementation-level maps to transparently group objects cloned from the same prototype, providing data type information and eliminating the apparent space overhead for prototype-based systems. To compensate for dynamic typing, user-defined control structures, and the lack of explicit variables, our system dynamically compiles multiple versions of a source method, each customized according to its receiver's map. Within each version the type of the receiver is fixed, and thus the compiler can statically bind and inline all messages sent to self. Message splitting and type prediction extract and preserve even more static type information, allowing the compiler to inline many other messages. Inlining dramatically improves performance and eliminates the need to hard-wire low-level methods such as +,==, and ifTrue:. Despite inlining and other optimizations, our system still supports interactive programming environments. The system traverses internal dependency lists to invalidate all compiled methods affected by a programming change. The debugger reconstructs inlined stack frames from compiler-generated debugging information, making inlining invisible to the SELF programmer.},

However, monitoring occupancy directly is intrusive, typically requiring the deployment of multiple environmental sensors, e.g., motion, acoustic, CO2, etc. In this paper, we explore the potential for Non-Intrusive Occupancy Monitoring (NIOM) by using electricity data from smart meters to infer occupancy. We first observe that a home's pattern of electricity usage generally changes when occupants are present due to their interact with electrical loads. We empirically evaluate these interactions by monitoring ground truth occupancy in two homes, then correlating it with changes in statistical metrics of smart meter data, such as power's mean and variance, over short intervals. In particular, we use each metric's maximum value at night as a proxy for its maximum value in an unoccupied home, and then signal occupancy whenever the daytime value exceeds it. Our results highlight NIOM's potential and its challenges.},

To prevent occupancy detection, we propose using the thermal energy storage of electric water heaters already present in many homes. In essence, our approach, which we call combined heat and privacy (CHPr), modulates a water heater's power usage to make it look like someone is always home. We design a CHPr-enabled water heater that regulates its energy usage to thwart a variety of occupancy detection attacks without violating its objective-to provide hot water on demand-and evaluate it in simulation using real data.

  abstract =     {This study uses high-frequency appliance-level electricity consumption data for 124 apartments over 24 months to provide a better understanding of appliance-level electricity consumption behavior. We conduct our analysis in a standardized set of apartments with similar appliances, which allows us to identify behavioral differences in electricity use. The Results show that households' estimations of appliance-level consumption are inaccurate and that they overestimate lighting use by 75% and underestimate plug-load use by 29%. We find that similar households using the same major appliances exhibit substantial variation in appliance-level electricity consumption. For example, households in the 75th percentile of HVAC usage use over four times as much electricity as a user in the 25th percentile. Additionally, we show that behavior accounts for 25–58% of this variation. Lastly, we find that replacing the existing refrigerator with a more energy-efficient model leads to overall energy savings of approximately 11%. This is equivalent to results from behavioral interventions targeting all appliances but might not be as cost effective. Our findings have important implications for behavior-based energy conservation policies.

Highlights
• Hourly electricity usage was collected from 124 comparable apartments for 24 months.
• Households overestimate lighting use by 75% and underestimate HVAC usage by 29%.
• Households using the same appliances show substantial variations in electricity use.
• Plug load accounts for the largest share of electricity use at all hours of the day.
• Savings of 11% were achieved by replacing old refrigerators.},

However, in general, usage data are generated progressively, visualizing how appliances are used from huge amount of data is challenging. Thus, an algorithm is needed to incrementally discover appliance usage patterns. Prior studies on usage pattern discovery are mainly focused on mining patterns while ignoring the incremental maintenance of mined results. In this paper, a novel method, Dynamic Correlation Miner (DCMiner), is developed to incrementally capture and maintain the usage correlations among appliances in a smart home environment. Furthermore, several optimization techniques are proposed to effectively reduce the search space. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is efficient in execution time and possesses great scalability. Subsequent application of DCMiner on a real dataset also demonstrates its practicability.},

  abstract =     {This paper presents the development, evaluation and application of the Domestic Energy and Carbon Model (DECM) for predicting the energy consumptions and carbon dioxide emissions of the existing English housing stock. A novel feature of DECM is the adoption of an occupancy pattern model which is derived from the household employment status data. We believe this modification has significantly improved the accuracy of the estimation in space heating energy use. At national level, the model estimation of carbon emissions and gas and electricity consumptions are respectively 4.5%, 3.4% and 1.0% higher than the national statistics. At the sub-national level (Local Authority), two methods are used to produce estimations: one based on dwelling type and the other based on socio-economic class. For both methods, the correlations between the model estimations and the government records are statistically significant and substantial (all rs &gt; 0.9 and ps&lt;0.01). According to the results, it can be inferred that over 85% of the variance in dwelling energy consumptions and carbon emissions can be accounted for by dwelling type and the socio-economic class of households. The paper presents a local sensitivity analysis which examines the effects of various building fabric and service system parameters on the modelled average carbon emissions per dwelling. Based on the findings, a set of predictive charts are developed which can provide rapid estimations of the effect of various energy efficiency measures on dwelling energy consumptions and carbon emissions taking into account the potential rebound effect. In summary, this paper shows that the DECM model can be a useful tool to assist the formation of energy efficiency policies at both national and local levels.},

  abstract =     {Direct feedback on energy use presented by in-home displays (IHDs) has been found to be useful in helping people learn about their energy use and make a reduction. However, it is not yet clear what is the best form in which to present energy information. Two six-week experiments were carried out in student residences at the University of Bath, UK, to investigate how visually displayed energy information presented in different ways could encourage reductions in energy use. Experiment 1 compared three energy display interface designs (one giving numerical information, one using analogue dials and one using emotional faces) all presenting the same information. This resulted in a 7.7% savings over baseline. Experiment 2 examined how well participants responded to ranking information in numerical format about their own consumption. This resulted in a 2.5% reduction from baseline. Although there was a trend towards the ambient faces display performing best, all the displays led to a reduction in energy use. A significant decrease in consumption was also seen in the groups that saw ranking information, whether compared to their baseline consumption or to the control groups. In conclusion, it would appear that the mere presence of a display device can reduce energy use, even when participants are not engaged with the display.

Highlights
• We report two experiments on display design for energy use feedback.
• All designs produced savings though no significant differences were found between them at the 0.95 level.
• Ambient (smiley face) design may have an advantage but needs further investigation.
• Peer-ranking information could play an important role in these reductions.},

This paper presents a laboratory study to investigate how the user interface of energy displays might be best designed. The work studied people's ability to spot changes in smart meters by comparing three different types of display design to see which was most effective in attracting attention to changing information, and whether the use of colour would also facilitate detecting changes. A computerised spot-the-difference task was undertaken; accuracy rates and response times were the key dependent variables, and qualitative information on participant preferences was gathered in interviews after the computerised task. Results showed that there was a difference between design types presenting the same information: simple numerical displays were superior to pictographic or analogue scale designs in both response time and accuracy. They also showed that the use of colour did not significantly affect performance. In general, participants also subjectively preferred numerical design for their in-home energy displays.},

The service provider learns only the region where the readings come from but not their respective identities. On the other hand, users with personal secret information can enquiry their usage history records or regional statistics.

The recurrent signals exchanged between layers are gated adaptively based on the previous hidden states and the current input. We evaluated the proposed GF-RNN with different types of recurrent units, such as tanh, long short-term memory and gated recurrent units, on the tasks of character-level language modeling and Python program evaluation. Our empirical evaluation of different RNN units, revealed that in both tasks, the GF-RNN outperforms the conventional approaches to build deep stacked RNNs. We suggest that the improvement arises because the GF-RNN can adaptively assign different layers to different timescales and layer-to-layer interactions (including the top-down ones which are not usually present in a stacked RNN) by learning to gate these interactions.},

These task-related, branch-specific Ca2+ spikes cause long-lasting potentiation of postsynaptic dendritic spines active at the time of spike generation. When somatostatin-expressing interneurons are inactivated, different motor tasks frequently induce Ca2+ spikes on the same branches. On those branches, spines potentiated during one task are depotentiated when they are active seconds before Ca2+ spikes induced by another task. Concomitantly, increased neuronal activity and performance improvement after learning one task are disrupted when another task is learned.

  abstract =    {Given the world's urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid the most disastrous effects of climate change, efforts must be made to reduce these emissions in every way possible. A large share of these emissions come from the energy consumption in buildings and there are significant opportunities to reduce this consumption through energy saving measures. Energy disaggregation or non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a useful tool that infers the energy consumption of individual appliances or equipment within a building from detailed measurements of the building's total energy consumption. This method is very attractive for providing a detailed breakdown of building energy consumption because it is less expensive and more convenient than measuring the energy use of each appliance individually. A wide variety of NILM methods have been proposed and in this thesis we focus on improving the feasibility of two different classes of NILM methods. We first explore the use of random filtering and random demodulation, two methods closely related to the new and developing field of compressed sensing (CS), to acquire and manage very-high-rate electrical measurements used for NILM. We show that these methods allow us to reduce the required sampling rate and volume of data collected while retaining valuable signal information required for NILM. Second, we switch to the analysis of very-low-rate data for NILM and develop a method to detect interesting patterns in the very-low-rate aggregate consumption signal. These patterns are shown to be responsible for a significant share of the total energy consumption in some buildings and are also related to the outdoor air temperature in some cases. Taken together, the two parts of this thesis allow us to contribute to the field of NILM by improving its feasibility and helping to facilitate its widespread use.},

  abstract =    {Over the past few decades, advances in technology, most notably the industrial revolution of the late 18th-century, has brought about dramatic improvements in the socioeconomic circumstances of developed nations. This has also brought with it rapid change in terms of human population, environmental impacts as well as energy consumption. Growth in energy consumption has been largely associated with increased use of finite fossil fuels (oil, coal, gas) in industrialized nations. However, this growth is unsustainable due to the depletion of these natural resources as well as the impact their consumption has on the environment, in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. A shift towards renewable fuels (wind, hydro, solar, geothermal, tidal) is currently underway, but progress remains slow, and the current reliance on fossil fuels for many existing essential technologies (e.g. transport) remains a major barrier to the large-scale transition that is required. 
 Energy efficiency has the potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and provide additional scope for the transition to a sustainable renewables-based energy future. Buildings account for approximately 40% of global energy consumption. Approximately half of this energy requirement stems from space heating and cooling. Studies have shown that savings of up to 40% are possible through the implementation of energy conservation measures (ECM's) and continuous commissioning (CC). 
 Whole building energy simulation tools have the potential to play a significant role in achieving this goal. However, their widespread adoption in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) industry depends on their perceived reliability and the accuracy of their outputs. Currently, simulation tools are used primarily in building design with little integration or comparison to real building operation. It is often found that the actual buildings perform far worse than the design simulation initially predicted. This gap between measured and simulated data needs to be carefully addressed. This thesis proposes a new methodology for calibrating building energy simulation (BES) models to measured data including the incorporation of parameter uncertainty into final model predictions and recommendations.},

  abstract =     {Whole building energy simulation (BES) models play a significant role in the design and optimisation of buildings. Simulation models may be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of energy-conservation measures (ECMs) in the design stage as well as assessing various performance optimisation measures during the operational stage. However, due to the complexity of the built environment and prevalence of large numbers of independent interacting variables, it is difficult to achieve an accurate representation of real-world building operation. Therefore, by reconciling model outputs with measured data, we can achieve more accurate and reliable results. This reconciliation of model outputs with measured data is known as calibration.

This paper presents a detailed review of current approaches to model development and calibration, highlighting the importance of uncertainty in the calibration process. This is accompanied by a detailed assessment of the various analytical and mathematical/statistical tools employed by practitioners to date, as well as a discussion on both the problems and the merits of the presented approaches.},

probability distribution functions to continuous

It reviews the history and precedents of UK Building Regulations and European building energy efficiency policies to identify what helped and hindered progress towards buildings that use less energy in operation; and compares and contrasts building energy certificates based on asset and operational ratings. It also looks at the development paths of operational rating schemes in the US and Australia. It identifies a tendency of regulators to focus on one part of the problem, the so-called ‘regulated loads'; an unhelpful split of government ownership of the topic between various ministries and agencies; a neglect of follow-through, enforcement and feedback; and a political rhetoric that favours an abdication of central government responsibilities to market forces.

The availability of data at such very high spatial and temporal resolution advanced the ability in characterizing, modeling, and, ultimately, designing user-oriented residential water demand management strategies. Research to date has been focusing on one or more of these aspects but with limited integration between the specialized methodologies developed so far. This manuscript is the first comprehensive review of the literature in this quickly evolving water research domain. The paper contributes a general framework for the classification of residential water demand modeling studies, which allows revising consolidated approaches, describing emerging trends, and identifying potential future developments. In particular, the future challenges posed by growing population demands, constrained sources of water supply and climate change impacts are expected to require more and more integrated procedures for effectively supporting residential water demand modeling and management in several countries across the world.},

  abstract =    {Under European Directives, all member states are required to install 'intelligent metering systems' - smart meters - to at least 80% of domestic electricity consumers by 2020. The UK Government has opted for a more challenging programme, with plans for energy suppliers to install smart electricity and gas meters in all homes and smaller non-domestic premises in Great Britain by 2019. We welcome the introduction of smart meters, but have concerns over the way the programme has been planned. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (the Department) estimates that the smart meters programme will cost some £11.7 billion. This is a large complex programme requiring replacing around 53 million gas and electricity meters with significant uncertainties over the estimated costs and benefits involved.

In particular, it is far from certain that all consumers will benefit from the regulatory requirement placed on suppliers to install smart meters in their homes. We recognise however that the Department will work to ensure that consumers do benefit from being able to monitor their energy costs. The costs of installing smart meters will be borne by consumers through their energy bills, but many of the benefits accrue in the first instance to energy suppliers. No transparent mechanism presently exists for ensuring savings to the supplier are passed on to consumers, and the track record of energy companies to date does not inspire confidence that this will happen.

The Department has acknowledged that it is accountable for delivering the programme, keeping the costs down and ensuring that consumers benefit through reduced bills from the lower costs borne by suppliers and reduced energy use. The Department insists that suppliers are best placed to deliver the programme and that competition between energy suppliers is the best way to ensure consumers benefit from suppliers' savings. We are concerned, however, that past performance suggests that competition does not work effectively in this market and should not be relied on to keep prices low.

There remain significant uncertainties in a number of key areas in the programme. Consumers may not be willing to cooperate with the installation of smart meters: the communications programme which is promised for 2012 is therefore absolutely vital to help consumers use smart meters to reduce consumption. Significant practical difficulties may arise in procuring and installing the required data communications service before the planned roll-out of smart meters in 2014 (at a projected cost of £3 billion). The Department needs to address remaining uncertainties by conducting proper trials to identify and manage the risks associated with an IT project involving such a substantial amount of money which is financed by individuals as consumers.

The Department needs to ensure that the vulnerable, those on low incomes and those who use prepayment meters also benefit from smart meters. It would be unacceptable if these consumers bore the costs of smart meters through higher charges without getting a share of the potential benefits. The Government must put in place measures to ensure vulnerable people are not readily disconnected if they fall behind with payments.

There are issues around cyber security which need to be addressed if confidence in this new technology is to be gained by the population who are expected to have smart meters in their home and pay for them.

On the basis of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, we took evidence from the Department on preparations for the roll-out of smart meters, including the procurement of the Data Communications Service.},

Energy Management Systems (HEMS) and other Information and Communication (ICT) based

paper attempts to quantify the energy reduction potential for HEMS/ICT through a systematic
treatment of monitoring data from real family homes. The analysis describes for the first time the
notion of the ‘Reduction Effort Balance’ that exists between capital expenditure and acceptance
of less comfort and convenience and it is demonstrated that HEMS/ICT could influence up to 50%
of the possible energy demand reduction. The findings also suggest that it is highly unlikely that
energy reduction targets will be met without changes to occupant lifestyle},

To validate our design, we deployed FigureEnergy "in the wild" -- 12 participants installed meters in their homes and used the system for a period of two weeks. The results suggest that the annotation approach is successful overall: by engaging with the data users started to relate energy consumption to activities rather than just to appliances. Moreover, they were able to discover that some appliances consume more than they expected, despite having had prior experience of using other electricity displays.},

The present proposal consists in recognizing user daily life activities by simply relying on the analysis of environmental sensory data in order to minimize energy consumption by guaranteeing that peak demands do not exceed a given threshold. Our approach is based on information theory in order to convert raw data into high-level events, used to represent recursively structured activities. Experiments based on publicly available datasets and consumption models are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposal.},

changes; it was co-developed by Balfour Beatty Military Housing Management (BB) and WattzOn in
Phase I of this grant. The program was offered at 11 Navy bases. Three customer engagement strategies
were evaluated, and it was found that Digital Nudges (a combination of monthly consumption
statements with frequent messaging via text or email) was most cost-effective. The program was
delivered on-time and on-budget, and its success is based on the teamwork of local BB staff and the
WattzOn team. The following graphic shows Switch4Good “by the numbers”, e.g. the scale of
operations achieved during Phase I.

Based on the success of Phase I, we propose to expand to 16 military communities and up to 8 cities in
Phase II, leveraging our experience with on-base communities to the broader residential market. As
smart meter installations grow to a projected 65 million homes by the end of 2015, and as Green Button
interface standards are more broadly available, behavior-based savings become more easily accessible
by consumers. Our innovative “house vs. habits” reports, based on 15-minute smart meter data are
already useful to property managers. Switch4Good has proven to be a scalable and successful program
that can be implemented across a variety of geographic and utility regions, and is poised to take
advantage of national trends in consumer energy management.},

The evolution of communications among the elements has permitted a more robust and adaptable structure that already is being implemented: the Smart Grid. The paper relates the evolution of EU policy concerning both the development and the rolling-out of solutions to exploit the potential of the Smart Grid concept and describes what has been done by the regulators of three countries that share the same goal but seek to attain it via distinct paths. The article starts with a justification of the need for more integrated networks and a definition of the Smart Grid. A second part covers the risks and difficulties of implementation within an established network, introducing the role of the regulator. The third part describes EU policy response and three different approaches by regulators in the UK, Italy and Portugal, showing how in each case policy is influenced by characteristics of their respective national electricity markets in terms of competition dynamics.

• Justification of the need for more integrated networks and definition of a Smart Grid.
• Risks and difficulties of implementing a Smart Grid within an established network.
• Description of EU policy response and 3 approaches by regulators: the UK, Italy and Portugal.},

Here we present a detailed stable-isotope record for the full length of the Greenland Ice-core Project Summit ice core, extending over the past 250 kyr according to a calculated timescale. We find that climate instability was not confined to the last glaciation, but appears also to have been marked during the last interglacial (as explored more fully in a companion paper) and during the previous Saale–Holstein glacial cycle. This is in contrast with the extreme stability of the Holocene, suggesting that recent climate stability may be the exception rather than the rule. The last interglacial seems to have lasted longer than is implied by the deep-sea SPECMAP record, in agreement with other land-based observations. We suggest that climate instability in the early part of the last interglacial may have delayed the melting of the Saalean ice sheets in America and Eurasia, perhaps accounting for this discrepancy},

  abstract =    {Most domestic energy use, most of the time, is invisible to the user. Most people
have only a vague idea of how much energy they are using for different purposes
and what sort of difference they could make by changing day-to-day behaviour or
investing in efficiency measures. Hence the importance of feedback in making
energy more visible and more amenable to understanding and control. This
review considers what is known about the effectiveness of feedback to
householders. The focus is on how people change their behaviour, not on the
detail of the technology used.
There is considerable variety in the feedback literature, but common themes
emerge. The first studies, in the 1970s, established that feedback (mostly via
display monitors) has measurable effects and was worth pursuing, on its own or
in combination with other processes. Feedback came to be seen in terms of a
learning tool, allowing energy users to teach themselves through
experimentation. Overall, the literature demonstrates that clear feedback is a
necessary element in learning how to control fuel use more effectively over a long
period of time and that instantaneous direct feedback in combination with
frequent, accurate billing (a form of indirect feedback) is needed as a basis for
sustained demand reduction. Thus feedback is useful on its own, as a self-
teaching tool. It is also clear that it improves the effectiveness of other
information and advice in achieving better understanding and control of energy
use.},

  abstract =     {The argument for the implementation of ‘smart’ metering, which is an elastic term, varies according to circumstance and place. In some countries, the business case for establishing an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) relies in part on improving consumption feedback to customers and assisting in the transition to lower-impact energy systems. There is an expectation that AMI will lead to reductions in both the demand and the cost to serve customers through improved communication, but little evidence exists to show overall demand reduction. To what extent might smart meters improve the prospects for customer engagement? To assess this question, end-user perceptions and practices must be considered along with metering hardware and economics. Using the theory of affordances, qualitative research is examined to understand how householders have used consumption feedback, with and without smart meters. Although AMI offers possibilities for household energy management and customer–utility relations, there is little evidence to suggest it will automatically achieve a significant reduction in energy demand. For that, there has to be a determined focus on overall demand reduction (rather than on peak electricity demand reduction), on designing customer interfaces for ease of understanding, and on guiding occupants towards appropriate action. Appropriate forms of interface, feedback, narrative, and support will be needed to reach diverse populations.},

Particular problems include having volunteer participants who may have been especially motivated to reduce their electricity use, letting participants choose their preferred intervention, and having high attrition rates. Using estimates of bias from medical clinical trials as a guide, we recalculate impact estimates to adjust for bias, resulting in values that are often less than half of those reported in the reviewed studies. We estimate that in-home displays were the most effective intervention for reducing overall electricity use (~4% using reported data; ~3% after adjusting for bias), while dynamic pricing significantly reduced peak demand (~11% reported; ~6% adjusted), especially when used in conjunction with home automation (~25% reported; ~14% adjusted). We conclude with recommendations that can improve pilot studies and the soundness of decisions based on their results.},

Lack of sufficiently accurate, timely information on energy use may prevent customers from taking informed decisions
to reduce consumption and thereby bills and CO2 emissions. The lack of accurate, timely information increases
suppliers' accounts management and switching costs. Better information on patterns of use across networks will aid in
network planning and development, including future smart grids.
Smart metering is a key enabling technology for managing energy systems more efficiently in the future, and providing
new information and services to consumers which reduce costs and carbon emissions. In Great Britain, the provision
of energy meters to consumers is the responsibility of energy retail suppliers, and is subject to competition. Although
some suppliers are rolling out smart meters to a selection of their customers it is expected that, in the absence of
intervention by Government, suppliers would roll out only limited numbers of smart meters. Government intervention is
needed to ensure commercial interoperability and full market coverage. This will facilitate the capture of wider benefits
to consumers, the environment, network operators and new businesses.
The policy for smart meters therefore addresses the market failures in the energy markets described above
(information asymmetries, lack of coordination and negative externalities from energy consumption).},

  abstract =    {This quarterly release presents statistics on the roll-out of smart meters in Great
Britain. It includes information on the number of smart meters that have been
installed in domestic properties and smaller non-domestic sites in the last quarter
and the total number of meters in operation as of 30 June 2015 by the nine larger
energy suppliers.

The Smart Metering Programme is currently in Foundation Stage, which began in
March 2011. The Government is working with the energy industry, consumer groups
and other stakeholders to put commercial and regulatory frameworks in place to
support smart metering, trial and test systems, learn lessons from early installations
and enhance the consumer experience. Most householders will then have smart
meters installed by their energy company in the period between 2016 and 2020.
Further information can be found on the GOV.UK website.

Energy suppliers are currently installing and operating smart meters, smart-type
meters and traditional meters in domestic properties and smart meters, advanced
meters and traditional meters in smaller non-domestic sites (an explanation of
differences between meter types can be found in Section 1.2 of the Introduction).

Key Points

* 272,600 smart meters (160,500 electricity meters and 112,100 gas meters)
were installed in domestic properties in quarter two 2015 (Figure 1 and Table 1), a 29 per cent increase on the number of meters installed during quarter one
2015. An estimated total of 1,327,400 domestic smart meters have been installed
up to 30 June 2015 by the larger energy suppliers.

* 1,193,200 smart meters are now operating in ‘smart mode’ in domestic
properties across Great Britain (Table 2). This represents an increase of 249,700
since the end of quarter one 2015 and 2.5 per cent of all domestic meters
operated by the larger energy suppliers (Figure 2).

* 2,300 smart meters (which includes 100 gas meters) and 16,400 advanced
meters (12,100 electricity meters and 4,300 gas meters) were installed in smaller
non-domestic sites in quarter two 2015 (Figure 3 and Table 3). An estimated total
of 621,400 smart and advanced meters have been installed to 30 June 2015 in
smaller non-domestic sites by the larger energy suppliers.

* 538,400 smart and advanced meters are now operating in smaller nondomestic
sites across Great Britain (Table 4). This represents 19.8 per cent of all
smaller non-domestic site meters operated by the larger energy suppliers
(Figure 4).},

Data on building characteristics and calculated performance from the Flemish Energy Performance of Buildings (EPB) database were complemented with data from energy utilities and surveys of inhabitants, their socio-demographic characteristics and user behaviours. While the real and theoretical energy uses were strongly correlated, the official calculation method overestimated the heating energy use of most houses while neglecting important electricity end uses. The prediction error varied strongly between individual cases. Two options within the calculation procedure had a significant impact on these prediction errors: the use of default values for the air tightness of the building envelope and the reported return temperature of the space heating system. The simplified calculation of net domestic hot water consumption and the real heating of the master bedrooms also affected prediction accuracy. However, extrapolations are hazardous due to the risk of selection and non-response biases implied by the approach and the need for further research into the causalities. Nonetheless, the findings stress the importance of accurate input data and realistic default values for calculation models used for high-performance buildings.},

We believe that Grids cannot become Smart Grids without the paradigm shift to the new era of
Energy Information Management. We believe that other manufacturing and Services sectors have
been able to modernize themselves and become more consumers oriented when they became

This method utilizes the Karhunen Loéve expansion to breakdown the active power signal into subspace components (SCs) so as to construct a unique information rich appliance signature. Unlike existing NILM techniques that rely on multiple measurements at high sampling rates, this method works effectively with a single active power measurement taken at a low sampling rate. After constructing the signature data base, SC level power conditions were introduced to reduce the number of possible appliance combinations prior to applying the maximum a posteriori estimation. Then, an appliances matching algorithm was presented to identify the turned-on appliance combination in a given time window. After identifying the turned-on appliance combination, an energy estimation algorithm was introduced to disaggregate the energy contribution of each individual appliance in that combination. The proposed NILM method was validated by using two public databases: 1) tracebase; and 2) reference energy disaggregation data set. The presented results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to accurately identify and disaggregate individual energy contributions of turned-on appliance combinations in real households.},

We therefore investigated consumers’ Smart Grid related privacy concerns in private and business contexts and focused on the research questions: (1) who is perceived as a trustworthy authority for energy data storage? (2) What can pose as a privacy threat for consumers? (3) How should energy data be handled by an ICT infrastructure?

New techniques to long-term water conservation that incorporate principles of sustainability are expected. Recent studies have shown that providing customers with usage information of fixtures could help them save a considerable amount of water. Existing disaggregation techniques focus on learning consumption patterns for individual devices. Little attention has been given to the hierarchical decomposition structure of the aggregated consumption. In this paper, a Deep Sparse Coding based Recursive Disaggregation Model (DSCRDM) is proposed for water conservation. We design a recursive decomposition structure to perform the disaggregation task, and introduce sequential set to capture its characteristics. An efficient and effective algorithm deep sparse coding is developed to automatically learn the disaggregation architecture, along with discriminative and reconstruction dictionaries for each layer. We demonstrated that our proposed approach significantly improved the performance of the benchmark methods on a large scale disaggregation task and illustrated how our model could provide practical feedbacks to customers for water conservation.},

Studies have shown that simply providing disaggregated data to the consumer improves energy consumption behavior. However, placing individual sensors on every device in a home is not presently a practical solution. Disaggregation provides a feasible method for providing energy usage behavior data to the consumer which utilizes currently existing infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel framework to perform the energy disaggregation task. We model each individual device as a single-input, single-output system, where the output is the power consumed by the device and the input is the device usage. In this framework, the task of disaggregation translates into finding inputs for each device that generates our observed power consumption. We describe an implementation of this framework, and show its results on simulated data as well as data from a small-scale experiment.},

Finally, we apply the results to real data to derive bounds on the probability of distinguishing between scenarios as a function of the measurement noise, the sampling rate, and the device usage.},

  abstract =    {The State of Minnesota Department of Commerce’s Division of Energy Resources (DER) contracted
with ILLUME Advising, LLC to complete a literature review study and benchmarking analysis of
electric and gas utility-implemented Conservation Improvement Programs (CIP) that use behavioral
techniques.1 The overarching objective of this effort was to provide the State of Minnesota with the
information necessary to make informed decisions regarding the design, evaluation, and claimed
savings approaches for these programs.
To achieve this end, the literature review and benchmarking analysis had three primary goals:
(1) To develop a working definition of behavioral CIP efforts to be used in Minnesota;
(2) To identify, enumerate, catalogue, and benchmark success metrics associate with behavioral
CIP efforts that have been evaluated to date (and are considered “evaluable”); and
(3) To determine practices associated with measurement, evaluation, and claiming2 of
behavioral CIP efforts to meet state and local resource acquisition goals.
To meet the first two goals, we first developed a working definition and taxonomy of behavioral CIP
efforts. We then screened CIP programs that met our definition for evaluated savings. We included
publicly available and evaluated programs that met our definition in our literature review, totaling
nearly 170 studies including meta-analyses conducted in North America. After reviewing this
research, we systematically categorized each program according to our taxonomy and then
catalogued available success metrics associated with these programs.3 Once the success metrics
were collected, we compared the success metrics across behavioral programs. The team conducted
20 interviews with behavioral program thought leaders and program implementers were used to
supplement our research and to identify publicly available data. Note, this work was designed to
catalogue behavioral CIP efforts and no additional analysis or meta-analyses were conducted as part
of this effort.
To meet the third goal, we consulted a number of sources to inform our findings and
recommendations. These sources included: (1) publicly available literature on CIP evaluation best
practices, (2) state filings and decisions related to CIP programs, (3) white papers pertaining to CIP
measure life, and (4) industry experts knowledgeable about CIP filings in states who have extended
CIP measure life.},

In such cases, accurate analysis of energy usage requires the deployment of a flexible embedded sensor network that can capture data at the required level of accuracy and granularity and can associate the energy usage data with the context and activity that has caused it. This research proposes an approach and a set of hardware and software tools for the monitoring of energy usage in technical building services and the association of that data with real-time production information in advanced manufacturing facilities. The system developed incorporates an embedded controller with sensors to monitor the physical environment, an integrated energy analyser to monitor electricity consumption and a visualisation interface that associate events in the physical world with the actual energy consumption recorded. The creation of a detailed time-stamped energy profile for the process can then be used in the identification of energy saving opportunities. A case study from a pharmaceutical facility was used to validate the operation of the system.},

The development of low-cost systems for profiling the consumption of electric appliances can play a key role in stimulating the users to adopt adequate policies for energy saving. In this paper, we describe a novel methodology for extracting the power consumption of each appliance deployed in a domestic environment from the aggregate measures collected by a single smart meter. In order to coarsely describe how each type of appliance works, we use finite-state machines (FSMs) based on fuzzy transitions. An ad-hoc disaggregation algorithm exploits a database of these FSMs for, at each meaningful variation in real and reactive aggregate powers, hypothesizing possible configurations of active appliances. This set of configurations is concurrently managed by the algorithm which, whenever requested, outputs the configuration with the highest confidence with respect to the sequence of detected events. We implemented a prototype of a monitoring system based on the proposed methodology and installed it in a real domestic scenario. We discuss an experiment in which 11 appliances were connected to the same circuit and the aggregate power consumption was measured by a smart meter for approximately 12 h. At the end of the experiment, only two possible configurations were outputs from the system, including the correct one.},

Using the information provided by smart meter power draw, valuable information can be extracted as disaggregated appliance power draws by non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). NILM allows to identify appliances according to their power characteristics in the total power consumption of a household, measured by one sensor, the smart meter. In this paper, we present an NILM approach, where the appliance states are estimated by particle filtering (PF). PF is used for nonlinear and non-Gaussian disturbed problems and is suitable to estimate the appliance state. ON/OFF appliances, multistate appliances, or combinations of them are modeled by hidden Markov models, and their combinations result in a factorial hidden Markov model modeling the household power demand. We evaluate the PF-based NILM approach on synthetic and on real data from a well-known dataset to show that our approach achieves an accuracy of 90% on real household power draws.},

Interoperability issues need to be solved among smart appliances as well as between smart and non-smart, i.e., legacy devices. We expect current standardization efforts to soon provide technologies to design smart appliances in order to cope with the current interoperability issues. Nevertheless, common electrical devices affect energy consumption significantly and therefore deserve consideration within energy management applications. This paper discusses the integration of smart and legacy devices into a generic system architecture and, subsequently, elaborates the requirements and components which are necessary to realize such an architecture including an application of load detection for the identification of running loads and their integration into existing HEM systems. We assess the feasibility of such an approach with a case study based on a measurement campaign on real households.

Recently, many different novel NILM approaches were introduced, tested on real-world data and evaluated with a common evaluation metric. However, the fair comparison between different NILM approaches even with the usage of the same evaluation metric is nearly impossible due to incomplete or missing problem definitions. Each NILM approach typically is evaluated under different test scenarios. Test results are thus influenced by the considered appliances, the number of used appliances, the device type representing the appliance and the pre-processing stages denoising the consumption data. This paper introduces a novel complexity measure of aggregated consumption data providing an assessment of the problem complexity affected by the used appliances, the appliance characteristics and the appliance usage over time. We test our load disaggregation complexity on different real-world datasets and with a state-of-the-art NILM approach. The introduced disaggregation complexity measure is able to classify the disaggregation problem based on the used appliance set and the considered measurement noise.},

These initiatives are opening the door to potential energy savings that, on average, have reduced individual household electricity consumption 4 to 12% across our multi-continent sample. In so doing, feedback is proving a critical first step in engaging and empowering consumers to thoughtfully manage their energy resources. On a national scale, our estimates indicate that feedback programs for the residential sector might generate electricity savings that range from as little as 0.4% to more than 6% of total residential electricity consumption. If broadly implemented throughout the United States using well-designed programs, residential sector feedback programs could provide the equivalent of 100 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity savings annually by 2030.

However, its impact on privacy analyses of load signals has never been studied systematically. Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring algorithms (NIALM) have originally been designed for energy disaggregation for subsequent energy feedback. However, the information on appliance use may also be misused for the extraction of personal information. In this work, the effect of decreasing the time resolution in the usual first step, namely edge detection, is studied. It is shown that event values can be estimated rather reliably, but the detection rate of events significantly decreases with increasing measurement time interval.},

In this paper, we propose a low-complexity disaggregation method based on Dynamic Time Warping algorithm that uses only active power aggregate smart meter data, captured at a low frequency, for training and disaggregation.

  abstract =  {In line with EU legislation, considerations for large-scale smart meter rollouts take place in a growing
number of Member States. However, it’s hypothesized success for energy savings should not be
taken for granted. Smart meters can only contribute to energy efficiency, if they come publicly
accepted and in line with engaging and empowering smart metering services. To help meeting these
preconditions, the EU-networking and dissemination project USmartConsumer encourages both
European market players and households to benefit from smart metering, among other things by
promoting scientific evidence and consumer interest.
The latest scientific evidence comes from the Netherlands. A large and multiple consumer behavior
pilot program, one of the largest scientific smart metering trials conducted worldwide to date, recently
added new evidence to the smart meter energy savings potential. As seen in similar trial programs in
the UK and Ireland, smart meters in combination with direct feedback can lead to considerable and
persistent household energy reductions. In-home displays appear to be a crucial ‘stepping stone’ to
kick-start consumer interest and engagement in accessing energy information, especially amongst
less committed or experienced consumers. Sophisticated web-based services on PC, tablet and
smart phone are potentially more powerful to help reduce energy demand, but in practice more so
with already committed and technology minded subsets of the population. Therefore, opt-in websites
or apps should not be considered as the contemporary substitute for in-home displays, but rather as a
complementary option. This paper elaborates on the outcomes of the Dutch pilot series and reflects
on the readiness of the market in the Netherlands to kick-start consumer interest.},

We propose a new supervised algorithm, which in the learning stage, automatically extracts signature consumption patterns of each device by modeling the device as a mixture of dynamical systems. In order to extract signature consumption patterns of a device corresponding to its different modes of operation, we define appropriate dissimilarities between energy snippets of the device and use them in a subset selection scheme, which we generalize to deal with time-series data. We then form a dictionary that consists of extracted power signatures across all devices. We cast the disaggregation problem as an optimization over a representation in the learned dictionary and incorporate several novel priors such as device-sparsity, knowledge about devices that do or do not work together as well as temporal consistency of the disaggregated solution. Real experiments on a publicly available energy dataset demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves promising results for energy disaggregation.},

Based on insights of the interrelation of load profile resolution and accuracy of NILM techniques, we propose the use of the wavelet transform to represent load data in multiple resolutions. Each resolution is encrypted with a different key using an appropriate cipher and a hierarchical keying scheme. End-to-end security ensures access control. To meet requirements of low computational complexity in low-cost smart meters, the lifting implementation of the wavelet transform is used to generate multiple resolutions. It is shown that the multiresolution approach is compatible with other privacy-enhancing technologies, such as secure signal processing. This allows adding new degrees of freedom to these methods by introducing the dimension of multiple resolutions. The proposed approach is evaluated based on the provided level of privacy and security, computational demands, and feasibility in an economic sense.},

Additionally, these systems can be used to achieve energy savings, e.g., by turning the appliances off during the user's absence. The configuration of such systems, however, represents a major hindrance to their widespread deployment, as each connected appliance must be individually configured and assigned an operation schedule. The detection of active appliances as well as their current operating mode represents an enabling technology on the way to truly smart buildings. Once appliance identities are known, the devices can be deactivated to save energy or automatically controlled to increase the user's comfort.

In this paper, we propose an approach to have buildings informed about the presence and activity of electric appliances. It relies on distributed high-frequency measurements of electrical voltage and current and feature extraction process that distills the collected data into distinct features. We utilize a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify readings into the underlying device type as well as its operation mode, which achieves an accuracy of up to 99.8%.},

The model naturally handles a variable number of instances for each class and allows for cross-class generalization at the highest levels of the network.

  abstract =  {Brussels, 17th February 2012 – Citizens and business often waste energy because they do not realise which appliances and lighting use the most energy. An EU-funded project tested in the United Kingdom and Bulgaria is helping to change that – showing consumers reduced energy usage by an average of 8% when provided with an "information dashboard" about their energy use.

The Digital Environment Home Energy Management System (DEHEMS) project shows that when a consumer receives more information about their energy use, and can share and compare this with neighbours and family, they are more likely to change their behaviour. The EU-funded system presents data every 6 seconds through a small digital display. The data can also be displayed in real time via a TV screen, mobile phone, PC or social media app.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes said: "People make better choices when they have better information at hand. The DEHEMS project shows that very simple technologies can go a long way to helping Europe reduce energy use."

The DEHEMS system could set a huge trend in the coming years. Two commercial products are now available: The "Energyhive" (www.energyhive.co.uk) and its network that enables members to get a real time view of their home energy consumption 24/7 through a web browser and "Greenica" (www.greenica.net) which offers special products for homes, schools and small businesses. Thanks to a partnership between Hildebrand and IBM, the DEHEMS project and its lessons will soon be used by businesses both in Europe and worldwide. Major deployment is foreseen with Smart Grids Australia (involving 50,000 homes) and a district heating initiative in Camden, London. Last but not least, the Family House Association in Birmingham is looking to use DEHEMS-type technology thanks to the results achieved so far.},

The findings demonstrate that a few countries such as China, India and Brazil have had proper planning and development in this technology.

For example, Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitor (NIALM) techniques, aiming at energy monitoring, load forecasting and improved control of residential electrical appliances, have been developed by monitoring one electrical circuit that contains a number of electrical appliances without using separate sub-meters. By employing pattern recognition algorithms, the NIALM techniques estimate the consumption of individual appliances. While the basic ideas behind the NIALM techniques are valid, existing proposals suffer from the issue of poor estimation accuracy. In this paper, we model the process of load separation in NIALM as a time series disaggregation problem. Aiming at achieving high estimation accuracy and alleviating excessive computation, we develop a time-series disaggregation algorithm which incorporates two novel techniques, namely, DE-pruning and monotonic enumeration, for search space pruning. A comprehensive set of experiments are conducted to validate our proposals and to evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed methods. The result shows that our proposal is effective and efficient.},

It also required a one-time submetering of the target appliances during the training period, of about a week, to find the electric characteristics of appliances. The results are provided in terms of daily load profiles, energy consumption and energy contribution of selected appliances. The proposed method was tested with monitored data from 3 weeks: (i) the training period of 1 week in October, (ii) the near-to-date testing period of 1 week in November and (iii) the far-to-date testing period of 1 week in January. For instance, the difference between monitored and estimated contribution is, for the month of October 1996, as follows: (i) 13 kW h or $0.85 for the DHW heater and (ii) 6 kW h or $0.36 for the refrigerator. The overall difference for both appliances does not exceed $1.25 for the month of October, for a total electricity bill of 912 kW h and $60.60, which appears to be acceptable for every homeowner.

  abstract =     {In theory, In-Home Displays (IHDs) can revolutionize the way utilities communicate information to customers because they can induce changes in customer behavior even when they are not accompanied by a change in electric prices or rebates for purchasing efficient equipment. IHDs provide consumers with direct feedback—real-time information on energy consumption and costs—and turn a once opaque and static electric bill into a transparent, dynamic, and controllable process. However, to what extent do consumers actually respond to the direct feedback provided by IHDs? In this paper, we seek to empirically answer this question by reviewing a dozen utility pilot programs in North America and abroad that focus on the energy conservation impact of IHDs. We also review overall customer opinions and attitudes towards IHDs and direct feedback to the extent that this information is available from the pilot studies. Our review indicates that the direct feedback provided by IHDs encourages consumers to make more efficient use of energy. We find that consumers who actively use an IHD can reduce their consumption of electricity on average by about 7 percent when prepayment of electricity is not involved. When consumers both use an IHD and are on an electricity prepayment system, they can reduce their electricity consumption by about twice that amount. In regard to demand response impacts, we find that the impact of time-of-use rates is augmented by direct feedback from IHDs.},

Selected performance ‘failures’ that became evident during operation of CIRS are studied for how they were discovered and the efforts required for their resolution: the energy systems and associated controls and monitoring. The key findings show the barriers were neither economic nor technical. Instead, the primary impediments were institutional regimes – arising from the ways that various life-cycle stages were specified, contracted and implemented. The key issues emphasize the importance of having meaningful and effective building energy monitoring capabilities, an understanding of energy system boundaries in design and analysis, crossing the gaps between different stages of a building life cycle, and feedback processes throughout design and operation.

  abstract =     {Domestic demand-side response (DSR), if widely adopted, could help make electricity more secure, clean and affordable. However, little is known about consumer demand for different approaches to achieving DSR. This study aimed to gauge the acceptability of a range of DSR tariffs, and explore factors affecting it. An online between-subjects survey experiment was deployed to a representative sample of bill payers in Great Britain (N = 2002), testing five tariffs including static/dynamic time of use (TOU) pricing (with/without automated response to price changes) and direct load control (DLC) of heating on a below-average flat rate. The tariff permitting limited DLC of heating was significantly (p &lt; .01) more popular than the TOU tariffs. This was surprising given evidence for concern around loss of control in DLC, and suggests that for many people DLC is acceptable in principle (within tight bounds and with override ability). The option of automated response made dynamic TOU (otherwise the least popular tariff) as acceptable as static TOU. This is important because dynamic TOU offers additional network benefits, while automation can improve duration and reliability of response. The TOU tariffs were rated highly for giving people control over spending on electricity, but other factors were more associated with overall acceptance.

Highlights
• Representative survey measured acceptability of demand-side response tariffs in Britain.
• Thirty per cent strongly/somewhat in favor of switching to static time of use tariff.
• Direct load control, with override and tightly bounded, acceptable in principle to many.
• Option of automated response made dynamic time of use tariff as acceptable as static.},

  abstract =  {The popularity of reducing domestic electricity consumption is growing following the decision of several European governments to quit nuclear power in the near future. However, finding out which equipment should be replaced and more importantly which behavior should be modified to reach this goal is not a simple task, since helpful tools are not easy to find or implement. The disaggregation of the global electricity consumption could be achieved in the framework of concepts like the Internet of Things where the monitoring of each appliance is made possible using embedded power sensors. However, the implementation of such solutions in the near future will be very difficult due to the costs generated by the modification of existing appliances. Another more elegant solution to provide people with useful information about their electricity consumption consists in a single recording unit measuring the entire consumption coupled with a system able to disaggregate the appliance load curve. This is better known as non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM). The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a load curve disaggregation based feedback system for consumer service development. For that purpose, a low-frequency recording unit was developed to record the global electricity consumption of fifty Swiss households. The recorded data, as well as simulated data, have been used to develop and validate a simple appliance detection technique with low computational requirements as this is a key issue for a potential future use in real-time remote feedback systems. This paper shows that the developed disaggregation technique, although simple, provides satisfactorily detection performances and could be used to provide consumers with useful information about their electricity consumption.},

The most well-known examples are energy monitoring, health care applications, in-home activity modeling, and home automation. Real-time energy-use analysis for whole-home approaches needs to understand where and when the electrical loads are spent. Studies have shown that individual loads can be detected (and disaggregated) from sampling the power at one single point (e.g. the electric service entrance for the house) using a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) approach. In this paper, we focus on the feature extraction and pattern recognition tasks for non-intrusive residential electrical consumption traces. In particular, we develop an algorithm capable of determining the step-changes in signals that occur whenever a device is turned on or off, and which allows for the definition of a unique signature (ID) for each device. This algorithm makes use of features extracted from active and reactive powers and power factor. The classification task is carried out by Support Vector Machines and 5-Nearest Neighbors methods. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed signature for distinguishing the different loads.},

A solution for the electrical consumption management problem is the use of a non-intrusive load monitoring system (NILM). This system captures the signals from the aggregate consumption, extracts the features from these signals and classifies the extracted features in order to identify the switched on appliances. An effective device identification (ID) requires a signature to be assigned for each appliance. Moreover, to specify an ID for each device, signal processing techniques are needed for extracting the relevant features. This paper describes a technique for the steady-states recognition in an electrical digital signal as the first stage for the implementation of an innovative NILM. Furthermore, the final goal is to develop an intelligent system for the identification of the appliances by automated learning. The proposed approach is based on the ratio value between rectangular areas defined by the signal samples. The computational experiments show the method effectiveness for the accurate steady-states identification in the electrical input signals.},

  abstract =    {Tomorrow's main energy resource may well be energy efficiency. Over the last years, society awareness on environmental changes and high energy costs has been increasing. Nevertheless, the improper use of electrical devices still represents a substantial slice of the electrical energy consumption. Continuous and detailed electricity monitoring has been demonstrated an essential tool to ensure energy efficient in buildings as our homes. Appliance-specific consumption information empowers consumers, leading to informed choices and change of behaviours. Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) systems, aiming at energy monitoring, load forecasting and improved control of residential appliances, are an attractive solution to bring detailed consumption at device-level to end-users. Using only the aggregated electricity consumption data acquired at a single-point, usually the utility-customer interface, NILM discerns appliances' power usage data employing machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms. Due to its possible low cost, easy installation and easy integration into the future smart grids, which would enable consumers to participate in the electricity market, NILM has become an active area of research. This Thesis is concerned with energy disaggregation as the key part of a NILM framework. Given the whole-home electrical consumption data it aims at investigating and exploring methodologies not yet applied to tackle the correct disaggregation of this signal into the detailed usage of each appliance, or groups of devices, connected to the home electrical circuit. Widespread NILM approaches usually explore the disaggregation of single-point acquired data as a classification problem for which appliances signatures are required. Yet, no set of distinctive characteristics able to accurately describe each appliance has been found. Thereby, this thesis reinforces the search for the set of features used as appliances signatures. Namely, a rule for steady-state identification and its mathematical proof are introduced. This rule was applied for detection of step-changes occurring in the active and reactive power signals and the power factor measurements. The step-changes identified comprised a new appliance signature posteriorly used by the 5-Nearest Neighbours and the Support Vector Machines classification methods in order to obtain the appliance identification. The computational experiments yielded in real-world dataset showed the effectiveness of the proposed signature for distinguishing the different loads in study. The disaggregation and extraction of meaningful information from the aggregated electricity consumption can alternatively be interpreted in the light of signal processing analysis. In this sense, signal processing and time series analysis strategies arise as suitable tools for the extraction of information from the whole-home signal. Before aiming at the calculation of consumption estimates for each appliance, a previous study concerning the extraction of variations in the aggregated electrical signal associated with devices that work automatically without any human intervention is performed. In this context, a technique based on Wavelet Shrinkage and signal processing operations, designed to extract information from the aggregated signal considering several of its segments that can be analysed by distinct mother wavelets, is proposed. Following this path, a novel way to look into the issue of energy disaggregation is its interpretation as a single-channel source separation problem. To this end, the performance of source modelling based on multi-way arrays (tensors) and correspondent factorization is analysed. With the proviso that a tensor composed by the data for the several devices in the house is given, non-negative tensor factorization is performed in order to extract the most relevant components. The outcome is later embedded in the test step, where only the whole-home measured consumption is available. Inference of individual consumptions is then achieved by matrix factorization using the learned models. The approaches based on signal processing, for the extraction and disaggregation of information from the whole-home electrical signal, were successfully evaluated on a real-world dataset, as illustrated by the favourable performance and statistical evidence. Overall, this Thesis contributes with electrical energy disaggregation approaches, successfully validated on real-world data, which - as we hope - will have a positive impact in solving efficiency problems in a smart home.},

New techniques are developed which estimate the electricity consumption of different appliance groups, based on analysis of the five-minutely monitored data. The overall increase in electricity consumption is attributed to a 10.2% increase in the consumption of ‘standby’ appliances (such as televisions and consumer electronics) and a 4.7% increase in the consumption of ‘active’ appliance (such as lighting, kettles and electric showers). The consumption of different energy user groups (low, medium and high) is also investigated and low and high users are identified as contributing to the overall increase in consumption.

  abstract =  {The German Energy Concept, contains absolute energy savings targets as compared to a 2008 (or,
for transport, 2005) baseline. The Ministry for Environment has commissioned the corresponding research
project “Potentials, framework conditions and instruments for reaching the energy consumption
targets of the Energy Concept.” It explores possibilities for reducing energy demand via behaviorrelated
measures in private households, looking at the areas of housing, appliances, mobility and food
This paper presents the approach and selected results from this ongoing project.
The project identifies priority measures and develops policy instruments in an iterative process including
the following steps: 1. Selecting possible measures, 2. Quantifying savings potentials; 3. Assessing
the ease of implementation of measures from a social science point of view; 4. Modeling economic
costs and benefits and determining distributional effects; 5. Assessing existing coverage by
policy instruments, and 6. Exploring new policy instruments.
A first result of the project is that most relevant efficiency potentials are already targeted by existing or
planned policy measures. The remaining measures are, to a great extent, lifestyle changes and curtailment
behaviour. The quantitative assessment shows that theoretically these measures could provide
a substantial contribution to the savings targets of the Energy Concept, if broken down to the
household sector. For example, 2020 primary energy and electricity savings targets could be reached
by these measures alone. In addition, all of them have negative GHG abatement costs, meaning that
they imply a financial gain. The social science and policy analysis show, however, that it is not easy to
overcome the barriers to implementation of such measures.
The paper illustrates the process and results for three measures in the area of appliances: Reducing
multiple appliance ownership, implementing absolute upper limits for appliance energy consumption,
and curtailment-related usage behaviour. Also, three policy instruments are explored: a cap on electricity
sales, life cycle cost information at the point of sale and a “scrap bonus” for old appliances.
While the “scrap bonus” cannot be recommended and the LCC information instrument needs further
development, the cap is a targeted instrument worth exploring.},

  abstract =    {This thesis presents the development of techniques which enable appliance recognition
in an Advanced Electricity Meter (AEM) to aid individuals reduce their domestic
electricity consumption. The key aspect is to provide immediate and disaggregated
information, down to appliance level, from a single point of measurement.

Three sets of features including the short term time domain, time dependent finite
state machine behaviour and time of day are identified by monitoring step changes in
the power consumption of the home. Associated with each feature set is a membership
which depicts the amount to which that feature set is representative of a particular
appliance. These memberships are combined in a novel framework to effectively
identify individual appliance state changes and hence appliance energy consumption.

An innovative mechanism is developed for generating short term time domain memberships.
Hierarchical and nearest neighbour clustering is used to train the AEM
by generating appliance prototypes which contain an indication of typical parameters.
From these prototypes probabilistic fuzzy memberships and possibilistic fuzzy
typicalities are calculated for new data points which correspond to appliance state
changes. These values are combined in a weighted geometric mean to produce novel
memberships which are determined to be appropriate for the domestic model.

A voltage independent feature space in the short term time domain is developed
based on a model of the appliance’s electrical interface. The components within that
interface are calculated and these, along with an indication of the appropriate model,
form a novel feature set which is used to represent appliances.

The techniques developed are verified with real data and are 99.8% accurate in a
laboratory based classification in the short term time domain. The work presented
in this thesis demonstrates the ability of the AEM to accurately track the energy
consumption of individual appliances.},

It builds upon a previous meta-review by ACEEE of small residential feedback pilot studies, and was undertaken to further investigate the range of savings found in the earlier report in light of recent large-scale pilots conducted in the U.S. and Europe.  The studies reviewed here tested various combinations of interventions, but we have limited our discussion to savings from interventions providing direct, real-time feedback on residential electricity consumption and prices through in-home displays, web interfaces, and prepayment meters.   Residential electricity savings from real-time feedback in the nine pilots reviewed here ranged from 0 to 19.5%, with average savings across the pilots of 3.8%. The largest savings came from the replacement of pre-existing prepayment meters in Northern Irish homes with new prepayment meters having a real-time display.  The smallest savings were observed in two pilots, which found no aggregate effect of real-time feedback on overall electricity consumption. One of the most promising results is that a small percentage of households in several of the pilots had large savings of up to 25%.  We propose calling this group the cybernetically sensitive, because they seem to respond more readily to feedback.},

analyzes existing studies of energy monitors, in particular the theories behind their design and the methods

do users really understand the information provided to them? Findings suggest that many aspects of energy
monitor design and information communication can have an impact on energy consumption, but that this
impact has limits. They also suggest that this potential is not yet fully understood, and that there are many
aspects of energy consumption and behavioral motivations that could be explored in future studies.},

  abstract =    {This research evaluated the impact of energy information upon business owners' energy perceptions and behaviors within their architectural and social context. Specifically, it investigated if business owners were using an online electricity monitor, and how their perceptions related to engagement with energy information. The research sample consisted of ten small business owners who had participated in a free energy assessment program run by the local government. As part of the program, participants agreed to make one change the assessment suggested and attend two informational meetings. One meeting covering general energy efficiency topics and another instructing participants in use of an online electricity monitor. Data was gathered in the form of participant interviews, copies of the energy assessments, and screen shots of the electricity monitor. Interviews in context with the business owners covered topics such as how energy information impacted motivations, behaviors, and perceived limitations. Findings indicated that although each participant expressed an interest in conserving energy, none were regularly engaging with their electricity consumption information through the online monitor. Business owners did not find the monitor useful because it did not provide them information that was relevant to their business or architectural context. This indicates that future monitor designs should make a greater effort to incorporate information about users and their contexts into the representations of energy information. Doing this could make energy information more relevant and engaging so that users can relate to it and integrate it into their behavioral routines.},

For this purpose, in a first step from a video recording of each rat, an activity profile was calculated, from which subsequently a set of meaningful properties was extracted. This set was finally used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Furthermore, specialized kernel functions, namely the so-called time resolved p-spectrum and modified optimal assignment kernels, were developed to calculate the similarity of activity profiles. Our method allows for a very reliable discrimination of animals treated with antidepressants of different classes (tricyclics imipramine and desipramine as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SSRI, fluoxetine) versus a vehicle-treated group. Moreover, our technique is able to classify between tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs.

Hilbert transform properties along with other mathematical tools are used to extract the characteristics of the more suitable uses for demand response policies from the aggregated load demand of the user. This is achieved without complex statistical analysis of the demand loads. The tool filters pulse waveforms (in this case, the components of daily demand) and provides the aggregator the main characteristics of load, both in normal state or under response to system events or market prices.},

Thus, the practical application of HMMs in modern systems involves considerable sophistication. The aim of this review is first to present the core architecture of a HMM-based LVCSR system and then describe the various refinements which are needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These refinements include feature projection, improved covariance modelling, discriminative parameter estimation, adaptation and normalisation, noise compensation and multi-pass system combination. The review concludes with a case study of LVCSR for Broadcast News and Conversation transcription in order to illustrate the techniques described.},

The test involved the automatic collection of access data to the application, and the administration of satisfaction questionnaires, interviews, and usability tasks in the tested families. The paper describes the results of the test and the ensuing re-design strategy, centered on better tailoring the application to the players' actions. The lessons learned can be useful to other persuasive games, since a good fit to the actions of the user is a precondition of effectiveness of any persuasive application.},

This shortage could be alleviated, if a large number of deferrable loads, particularly the high powered ones, could be moved from on-peak to off-peak times. However, conventional DSM strategies may not be suitable for India as the local conditions usually favor only inexpensive solutions with minimal dependence on the pre-existing infrastructure. In this work, we present nPlug, a smart plug that sits between the wall socket and deferrable loads such as water heaters, washing machines, and electric vehicles. nPlugs combine real-time sensing and analytics to infer peak periods as well as supply-demand imbalance and reschedule attached appliances in a decentralized manner to alleviate peaks whenever possible. They do not require any manual intervention by the end consumer nor any enhancements to the appliances or existing infrastructure. Some of nPlug's capabilities are demonstrated using experiments on a combination of synthetic and real data collected from plug-level energy monitors. Our results indicate that nPlug can be an effective and inexpensive technology to address the peaking shortage.},

Although the literature on electricity disaggregation and appliance identification is extensive, there is no consensus on the generalizability of the proposed solutions, especially with respect to the features that are extracted from voltage and current measurements. In this paper, we begin to address this problem by comparing the discriminative power of commonly used features. Specifically, we carry out tests on PLAID, a publicly available high-frequency dataset of hundreds of residential appliances. By examining how the classification accuracy changes with sampling frequency, we also explore the computational complexity of these techniques to understand the feasibility and design of a hardware setup that can perform these calculations in near real-time.},

  abstract =     {This paper examines the recent development of unconventional gas sources and specifically how
they will affect gas markets in China, India, and Australia.
Main Argument
Unconventional gas—comprised of coal bed methane (CBM), tight gas, and shale gas—will
likely play a more important role in nations’ supplies by 2020. China, India, and Australia are the
most likely nations in the Asia-Pacific to follow the United States’ example of changing liquefied
natural gas (LNG) supplies by exploiting unconventional reserves. China, already a large
producer of tight gas, will likely not see greater production in shale and CBM for several more
years. India also has potential for CBM extraction due to plentiful coal reserves, but coal blocks
allocated for CBM development a decade ago have not produced tangible supplies. Australia, however, has planned projects in all three categories of unconventional gas, which accounts for
45% of Australia’s announced LNG export capacity. Though technical, logistic, economic, environmental, and commercial challenges will likely prevent all planned Australian projects
from being completed by 2020, the potential for greater Australian LNG exports through
unconventional gas is evident.
Policy Implications
Though extraction efforts are in their nascent stage, India and China could become more
self-sufficient in the natural gas market if they pursued unconventional gas sources in as
aggressive a manner as Australia.
U.S. technological advances in shale gas extraction could serve as a model for increased
shale gas extraction in Asian nations.
While Australia is a leading producer and exporter of unconventional gas and stands to
greatly increase its exports over the next decade, the country is unlikely to maximize its
potential unless high cost and logistical complexities for planned ventures are remedied.
There is great potential for LNG oversupply in Asia, which could result in lower prices to
stimulate greater demand, delays in the start of projects, lower utilization rates in supply
projects, or the export of LNG outside traditional consumption centers.},

Demand side management techniques found in literature are overviewed and a novel electricity demand control technique using real-time pricing is proposed. Currently users have no means to change their power consumption to benefit the whole system. The proposed method consists of modern system identification and control that would enable user side load control. This would potentially balance demand side with supply side more effectively and would also reduce peak demand and make the whole system more efficient.

Highlights
• An overview, drivers and benefits for demand side management in smart grid.

• We model a novel technique where load responds to price.
• Learn the behaviour and control load using price signal.
• This increases efficiency, reduces carbon emissions and cuts down costs.},

In an HMM, information about the past is conveyed through a single discrete variableâthe hidden state. We discuss a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations, and relate it to the forwardâbackward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods. Within the variational framework, we present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for learning the parameters of the model. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that factorial HMMs can capture statistical structure in this data set which an unconstrained HMM cannot.},

improving energy efficiency may save less energy than expected due to a rebound of energy use?
Is there any validity to the claims that energy efficiency improvements can actually lead to an
increase in energy use (known as “backfire”)? This article clarifies what the rebound effect is,
and provides a guide for economists and policymakers interested in its existence and magnitude.
We discuss how some studies in the literature consider a rebound effect that results from a
costless exogenous increase in energy efficiency, while others examine the effects of a specific
energy efficiency policy—a distinction that leads to very different welfare and policy
implications. We present the most reliable evidence available about the size of the energy
efficiency rebound effect, and discuss situations where such estimation is extraordinarily
difficult. With this in mind, we present a new way of thinking about the macroeconomic rebound
effect. We conclude that overall, the existing research provides little support for the so-called
backfire hypothesis. However, our understanding of the macroeconomic rebound effect remains
limited, particularly as it relates to induced innovation and productivity growth.},

  abstract =     {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a set of techniques used to estimate the electricity consumed by individual appliances in a building from measurements of the total electrical consumption. Most commonly, \{NILM\} works by first attributing any significant change in the total power consumption (also known as an event) to a specific load and subsequently using these attributions (i.e. the labels for the events) to estimate energy for each load. For this last step, most published work in the field makes simplifying assumptions to make the problem more tractable. In this paper, we present a framework for creating appliance models based on classification labels and aggregate power measurements that can help to relax many of these assumptions. Our framework automatically builds models for appliances to perform energy estimation. The model relies on feature extraction, clustering via affinity propagation, perturbation of extracted states to ensure that they mimic appliance behavior, creation of finite state models, correction of any errors in classification that might violate the model, and estimation of energy based on corrected labels. We evaluate our framework on 3 houses from standard datasets in the field and show that the framework can learn data-driven models based on event labels and use that to estimate energy with lower error margins (e.g., 1.1–42.3%) than when using the heuristic models used by others.},

  abstract =     {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has been studied for a few decades now as a method of disaggregating information about appliance level power consumption in a building from aggregate measurements of voltage and/or current obtained at a centralized location in the electrical system. When such information is provided to the electricity consumer as feedback, they can then take the necessary steps to modify their behavior and conserve electricity. Research has shown potential for savings of up to 20% through this kind of feedback. The training phase required to allow the algorithms to recognize appliances in the home at the beginning of a NILM setup is a big hindrance to wide adoption of the technique. One of the recent advances in this research area includes the addition of an Electro-Magnetic Field (EMF) sensor that measures the electric and magnetic field nearby an appliance to detect its operational state. This information, when coupled with the aggregate power consumption data for the home, can help to train a NILM system, which is a significant step forward in automating the training phase. This paper explores the theory behind the operation of the EMF sensor and discusses the feasibility of automating the training and classification process using these devices. A case study is presented, where magnetic field measurements of eight appliances are analyzed to determine the viability of using these signals alone to determine the type of appliance that the EMF sensor has been placed next to. Various dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to the collected data, and the resulting feature vectors are used to train a variety of common machine learning classifiers. A vector subspace obtained using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), along with a k-NN classifier, was found to perform best among the different alternatives explored. Possible reasons behind the findings are discussed and areas for further exploration are proposed.},

The IDEAL project uses a variety of IT methods to investigate whether, and in which social groups, feedback of personalised, household-specific and behaviour-specific information results in greater reduction in energy use than overall consumption information reported by Smart Meters. It is a sociotechnical study, concentrated on existing housing, with a strong social science component and an experimental design that looks at income levels and household composition as primary factors. Temperature and humidity data related to behaviour is gathered using a small number of wireless sensors in the home, together with data on weather, building factors and household composition. This data is streamed over the internet to servers where it is analysed using Bayesian machine-learning methods to extract household-specific behaviours in near-realtime. Information on the cost, carbon content and amount of energy used for specific behaviours is reported back to the householders via a dedicated wireless tablet. This interactive content is automatically generated using multimedia methods based on natural language generation techniques. The project is in its design phase, with the main project planned (and funded) to run 2013-2016. It is anticipated to demonstrate whether such low-cost sensing, analysis and feedback is significantly more effective than standard Smart Meters in reducing demand, and a business opportunity for green service organisations.},

  abstract =  {Along with the proliferation of the Smart Grid, power load disaggregation is a research area that is lately gaining a lot of popularity due to the interest of energy distribution companies and customers in identifying consumption patterns towards improving the way the energy is produced and consumed (via e.g. demand side management strategies). Such data can be extracted by using smart meters, but the expensive cost of incorporating a monitoring device for each appliance jeopardizes significantly the massive implementation of any straightforward approach. When resorting to a single meter to monitor the global consumption of the house at hand, the identification of the different appliances giving rise to the recorded consumption profile renders a particular instance of the so-called source separation problem, for which a number of algorithmic proposals have been reported in the literature. This paper gravitates on the applicability of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to perform this power disaggregation treating the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). The discussed experimental results utilize data contained in the REDD dataset, which corresponds to real power consumption traces of different households. Although the experiments carried out in this work reveal that the ACO solver can be successfully applied to the Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring problems, further work is needed towards assessing its performance when tackling more diverse appliance models and noisy power load traces.},

  abstract =     {Smart grids are a key feature of future energy scenarios, with the overarching goal of better aligning energy generation and demand. The work presented here considers the role of the user in such systems, and the contexts in which such roles might emerge. The data used is drawn from focus groups with 72 participants, using novel scenario techniques to contextualise smart grid technologies in domestic settings. Two contrasting visions of the smart grid are presented, a centralised system based on current institutional arrangements, and an alternative system in which decentralisation of generation and control is pursued. Using the concepts of ‘energy consumer’ and ‘energy citizen’, the paper considers what forms of engagement are likely to be generated by the two visions. We propose that smart grid designs must look beyond simply the technology and recognise that a smart user who is actively engaged with energy is critical to much of what is proposed by demand side management. We conclude that the energy citizen holds out most promise in this regard. The implications of this for policy makers are discussed.

Highlights
• Many DSM interventions require a shift in the role of electricity for users.
• Microgeneration is an effective means of achieving deeper engagement with energy.
• Deep distrust of electricity industry contrasts with popular community schemes.
• DSM targeting the ‘energy consumer’ will struggle to achieve its potential.
• The ‘energy citizen’ offers a more deeply engaged participant in DSM systems.},

  abstract =     {Due to the growth of electric end-uses, the management of the variations in time of the electric power demand has become essential, especially in the residential sector. According to this issue, the anticipation of the power demand is of great interest. This implies a better knowledge of the electric load curve of the household stock. Papers about understanding and forecasting energy demand are numerous but studies on building's load curves are rare. In this paper we propose a cross analysis of some existing methods capable of building up a residential electric load curve. Two main types of load curve models have been identified in the literature: top-down and bottom-up methods. Even if the review presents two existing top-down approaches, the authors focused the further analysis on bottom-up models. For each of them we first identify its functional characteristics: finality and scope, input data required, output format, modeled appliances and end-uses covered, generation of the diversity and validation of the model. Secondly, we establish a bloc diagram representing its architecture with focus on the mathematical model chosen. Finally, the authors list the limits of the model in view of the criteria needed to build up an ideal, bottom-up and technically explicit load curve model for the residential sector. A cross reading of the different methodologies is proposed through a global table that characterizes and sums up the analyzed models. Moreover, a graphical representation of the models studied is proposed, according to three criteria (range of application, modelling of the diversity, time scale accuracy) that allows us to compare them “at a glance”. To conclude, an identification of the gaps among existing models is proposed. It consists of listing the end-uses, the appliances and other behavioural correlations which may affect the load curve and that are not included in the reviewed methodologies and need further research.},

The system is based on a combination of the deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network architecture and the Connectionist Temporal Classification objective function. A modification to the objective function is introduced that trains the network to minimise the expectation of an arbitrary transcription loss function. This allows a direct optimisation of the word error rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or language model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3% on the Wall Street Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9% with only a lexicon of allowed words, and 8.2% with a trigram language model. Combining the network with a baseline system further reduces the error rate to 6.7%.},

However, the results in that work relied on recurrent-neural-network-specific objective functions, which are difficult to integrate with existing large vocabulary speech recognition systems. This paper investigates the use of DBLSTM as an acoustic model in a standard neural network-HMM hybrid system. We find that a DBLSTM-HMM hybrid gives equally good results on TIMIT as the previous work. It also outperforms both GMM and deep network benchmarks on a subset of the Wall Street Journal corpus. However the improvement in word error rate over the deep network is modest, despite a great increase in framelevel accuracy. We conclude that the hybrid approach with DBLSTM appears to be well suited for tasks where acoustic modelling predominates. Further investigation needs to be conducted to understand how to better leverage the improvements in frame-level accuracy towards better word error rates.},

  abstract =     {Recognizing lines of unconstrained handwritten text is a challenging task. The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7 percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance.},

Key tensions in the literature centered on (1) the EPR ("container" or "itinerary"); (2) the EPR user ("information-processer" or "member of socio-technical network"); (3) organizational context ("the setting within which the EPR is implemented" or "the EPR-in-use"); (4) clinical work ("decision making" or "situated practice"); (5) the process of change ("the logic of determinism" or "the logic of opposition"); (6) implementation success ("objectively defined" or "socially negotiated"); and (7) complexity and scale ("the bigger the better" or "small is beautiful").The findings suggest that EPR use will always require human input to recontextualize knowledge; that even though secondary work (audit, research, billing) may be made more efficient by the EPR, primary clinical work may be made less efficient; that paper may offer a unique degree of ecological flexibility; and that smaller EPR systems may sometimes be more efficient and effective than larger ones.

  abstract =     {Producing literature reviews of complex evidence for policymaking questions is a challenging methodological area. There are several established and emerging approaches to such reviews, but unanswered questions remain, especially around how to begin to make sense of large data sets drawn from heterogeneous sources.

Drawing on Kuhn's notion of scientific paradigms, we developed a new method—meta-narrative review—for sorting and interpreting the 1024 sources identified in our exploratory searches. We took as our initial unit of analysis the unfolding ‘storyline’ of a research tradition over time. We mapped these storylines by using both electronic and manual tracking to trace the influence of seminal theoretical and empirical work on subsequent research within a tradition. We then drew variously on the different storylines to build up a rich picture of our field of study. We identified 13 key meta-narratives from literatures as disparate as rural sociology, clinical epidemiology, marketing and organisational studies. Researchers in different traditions had conceptualised, explained and investigated diffusion of innovations differently and had used different criteria for judging the quality of empirical work. Moreover, they told very different over-arching stories of the progress of their research. Within each tradition, accounts of research depicted human characters emplotted in a story of (in the early stages) pioneering endeavour and (later) systematic puzzle-solving, variously embellished with scientific dramas, surprises and ‘twists in the plot’. By first separating out, and then drawing together, these different meta-narratives, we produced a synthesis that embraced the many complexities and ambiguities of ‘diffusion of innovations’ in an organisational setting. We were able to make sense of seemingly contradictory data by systematically exposing and exploring tensions between research paradigms as set out in their over-arching storylines. In some traditions, scientific revolutions were identifiable in which breakaway researchers had abandoned the prevailing paradigm and introduced a new set of concepts, theories and empirical methods. We concluded that meta-narrative review adds value to the synthesis of heterogeneous bodies of literature, in which different groups of scientists have conceptualised and investigated the ‘same’ problem in different ways and produced seemingly contradictory findings. Its contribution to the mixed economy of methods for the systematic review of complex evidence should be explored further.},

The increasing interest in the residential consumption data is behind the roll-out of smart meters in large areas and led to intensified research efforts in new data acquisition technologies for the energy sector. This paper introduces a novel model for generation of residential energy consumption profiles based on the energy demand contribution of each household appliance and calculated by using a probabilistic approach. The model takes into consideration a wide range of household appliances and its modular structure provides a high degree of flexibility. Residential consumption data generated by the proposed model are suitable for development of new services and applications such as residential real-time pricing schemes or tools for energy demand prediction. To demonstrate the main features of the model, an individual household consumption was created and the effects of a possible change in the user behaviour and the appliance configuration presented. In order to show the flexibility offered in creation of the aggregated demand, the detailed simulation results of an energy demand management algorithm applied to an aggregated user group are used.},

Real-time end user energy feedback, using disaggregated electric load composition, can play a pivotal role in motivating consumers towards energy conservation. Recent works have explored using high frequency conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) on power lines as a single point sensing parameter for monitoring common home appliances. However, key questions regarding the reliability and feasibility of using EMI signatures for non-intrusive load monitoring over multiple appliances across different sensing paradigms remain unanswered. This work presents some of the key challenges towards using EMI as a unique and time invariant feature for load disaggregation. In-depth empirical evaluations of a large number of appliances in different sensing configurations are carried out, in both laboratory and real world settings. Insights into the effects of external parameters such as line impedance, background noise and appliance coupling on the EMI behavior of an appliance are realized through simulations and measurements. A generic approach for simulating the EMI behavior of an appliance that can then be used to do a detailed analysis of real world phenomenology is presented. The simulation approach is validated with EMI data from a router. Our EMI dataset - High Frequency EMI Dataset (HFED) is also released.},

ElectriSense relies on the fact that most modern consumer electronics and fluorescent lighting employ switch mode power supplies (SMPS) to achieve high efficiency. These power supplies continuously generate high frequency electromagnetic interference (EMI) during operation that propagates throughout a home's power wiring. We show both analytically and by in-home experimentation that EMI signals are stable and predictable based on the device's switching frequency characteristics. Unlike past transient noise-based solutions, this new approach provides the ability for EMI signatures to be applicable across homes while still being able to differentiate between similar devices in a home. We have evaluated our solution in seven homes, including one six-month deployment. Our results show that ElectriSense can identify and classify the usage of individual devices with a mean accuracy of 93.82%.},

Monitoring many different individual loads on customer premises is a costly, complex, and trouble-prone operation. The availability of a single instrument that could plug into the meter socket and measure individual premise loads would greatly simplify and reduce the cost of customer load monitoring. This report provides the test results of such a prototype instrument.

Background

Building upon university-level research, EPRI worked closely with Enetics, Inc. to develop and deliver in 1997 an instrument that could accurately measure individual residential loads from the meter socket. This approach minimizes the disruption to the homeowner and reduces the risk of damage to the instrumentation. Enetics successfully commercialized the instrument for the residential market. Enetics later developed an enhanced version of the instrument for use in commercial buildings with three-phase service. This program conducted beta tests of four Commercial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring System (CNILMS) instruments at three utility host sites.

Objective

To verify that the instrument was able to accurately and repeatedly disaggregate the customer loads from the meter socket; to build a load library of readily recognizable end-use loads; to identify design deficiencies or potential enhancements prior to final development and commercial introduction.

Approach

Four test instruments were installed at host customer sites provided by three utility companies. Data from the four instruments were captured, stored locally, and regularly uploaded to a remote server for diagnosis and evaluation. To verify the accuracy of the test instruments, parallel instrumentation was installed on many of the end-use loads.

Results

The CNILMS instruments were easily and quickly installed in all cases and the instrument proved to be very reliable and accurate for measuring overall load. In several cases, the instrument was able to detect the presence of over twenty individual loads. Serious limitations were identified in the current version, however. The CNILMS units were unable to:

o Identify individual loads if they turned on or off simultaneously.

o Successfully identify and properly calculate the energy consumption of multiple identical loads.

o Combine the individual loads in "multi-state" devices such as refrigerators into one load identifiable as "refrigerator," although the individual constituent loads were often recognizable.

o Correctly calculate the energy consumption of loads with variable thermal characteristics such as refrigerators.

o Identify a load signal and correlate that signal to a named load. A trained technician must manually assign a load name to the loads identified by the instrument.

EPRI Perspective

Each of the participating host utilities and their participating customers believe that there would be a large market for a successful CNILMS instrument in deregulated energy markets. Energy service companies or energy service suppliers would use the device to help customers compare the energy performance of individual buildings or stores; compare the energy performance of equipment against nameplate ratings; identify poorly performing equipment; resolve high-bill complaints; identify new equipment installed in buildings under performance energy contracts; and optimize overall energy use. It appears that the largest market need is for an instrument that can accurately measure the "big three" commercial loads -- HVAC, refrigeration, and lighting.

Traditional methods of measuring end-use loads in such customer premises require the installation of expensive, failure-prone instrumentation. The custom installation of such instrumentation generally means that it cannot be economically moved to another site and that it is therefore difficult to economically collect data from many sites. The CNILMS approach has tremendous appeal because of its low cost, rapid installation, ability to measure many different loads, and high reliability.

Unfortunately, the current state of development of the instrument is inadequate for commercial acceptance, and considerable additional R&D is required to bring the product to a state of commercial readiness. The instrument developer has development programs underway to resolve these outstanding issues.},

attention for smart grids to manage the required power demand

presented new opportunities for residential load scheduling
systems to improve energy consumption by shifting or curtailing
the demand required with respect to price change or emergency

system (ORLS) is proposed for dynamic scheduling of household
appliances on the basis of a time of use (TOU) pricing scheme
using iterative optimization method. The proposed load
scheduling system encourages customers to manage their energy
consumption to achieve lower energy bills and balance load
consumption. Simulation results show that employing the
proposed ORLS system benefits the customers by reducing their
energy bill and the utility companies by decreasing the peak load
of required customer load demand. The proposed residential load
scheduling system based on TOU allows customers to reduce
their energy bills by up to 31% and to decrease the peak load by
up to 35%.},

After examining relevant bodies of literature on the effects of energy feedback on consumption behaviour, and on the complex role of energy and appliances within household moral economies, the paper draws on qualitative evidence from interviews with 15 UK householders trialling smart energy monitors of differing levels of sophistication. It focuses specifically on householder motivations for acquiring the monitors, how the monitors have been used, how feedback has changed consumption behaviour, and the limitations to further behavioural change the householders experienced. The paper concludes by identifying significant implications for future research and policy in this area.},

  abstract =     {This paper reports on how, over a 12-month period, UK householders interacted with feedback on their domestic electricity consumption in a field trial of real time displays or smart energy monitors. Drawing on the findings of 11 follow-up qualitative interviews with householders involved in a ‘Visible Energy Trial’, the paper suggests that: (i) over time, smart energy monitors gradually become ‘backgrounded’ within normal household routines and practices; (ii) the monitors do increase householders’ knowledge of and confidence about the amount of electricity they consume; (iii) but, beyond a certain level and for a wide variety of reasons, the monitors do not necessarily encourage or motivate householders to reduce their levels of consumption; and (iv) once equipped with new knowledge and expertise about their levels of electricity consumption, household practices may become harder to change as householders realise the limits to their energy saving potential and become frustrated by the absence of wider policy and market support. The paper concludes by reflecting on the policy and research implications of these findings in relation to future transition pathways to a low-carbon economy.

Highlights

► We interviewed 11 householders who had used a smart energy monitor for 12 months. 
► The monitors did help interviewees learn about their energy use. 
► Over time, the monitors became ‘backgrounded’ within normal household routines. 
► After early behaviour changes, the monitors did not motivate further energy saving. 
► The monitors may ‘harden’ energy use patterns in the absence of wider support.},

But this relationship is complicated by several feedback processes—most importantly the hydrological cycle—that are not well understood. Changes in the Earth's greenhouse effect can be detected from variations in the spectrum of outgoing longwave radiation, which is a measure of how the Earth cools to space and carries the imprint of the gases that are responsible for the greenhouse effect. Here we analyse the difference between the spectra of the outgoing longwave radiation of the Earth as measured by orbiting spacecraft in 1970 and 1997. We find differences in the spectra that point to long-term changes in atmospheric CH4, CO2 and O3 as well as CFC-11 and CFC-12. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect that is consistent with concerns over radiative forcing of climate.},

By providing digital feedback (by email and web) to two thirds of participants and only giving half of these the social data, the study set out to test the effectiveness of the social norms approach at reducing domestic electricity consumption in a UK setting. Initial findings suggest little difference between the impact of individual feedback and individual plus social feedback but point to the importance of the granularity of feedback data and the inclusion, in future research, of large samples, extended data collection periods and adequate experimental controls.},

  abstract =     {Purpose
– The purpose of this paper is to present details of a large-scale experiment that evaluated the impact of communicating two types of feedback to householders regarding their domestic electricity consumption: feedback on their own consumption and feedback of both their own consumption and that of others in their locality.

Design/methodology/approach
– Digital technologies were used to automatically measure and communicate the electricity consumption of 316 UK residents for a period of 16 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: one involving no feedback; one involving feedback about a household's own usage, and one involving a household's own usage plus social norms feedback (the average consumption of others in the locality). At the end of the study, a selection of participants took part in interviews or focus groups.

Findings
– Both types of feedback (individual and individual-plus-social-norms) led to reductions in consumption of about 3 per cent. Those receiving social norms feedback were significantly more likely to engage with the information provided. However, the social norms information had no additional impact on consumption. Survey and interview data confirmed that participants from both conditions had been encouraged to adopt new energy-saving practices. The study concludes that near real-time individual feedback can be sufficient for usage reduction if it is provided in a historical format. It also suggests that the impact of social norms information may previously have been confounded with that of individual feedback.

Originality/value
– This is the first time that a controlled experiment in the field of domestic electricity consumption has compared the impact of real-time social norm information with that of information that only contains individual household usage.},

  abstract =     {A real-time electricity emissions estimating tool, the Locational Marginal Price Emissions Estimation Method (LEEM), is assessed for its ability to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), global warming potential measured as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) on a residential scale. Through LEEM, residential electricity use can be shifted to low emissions times of day. In the study area of Michigan, USA emissions from five types of appliances (hot water heater, refrigerator defrost, dishwasher, clothes washer, and clothes dryer) were calculated to be theoretically reduced by 21–35% annually through a “best-case” application of LEEM. Annual emissions of the five pollutants, SO2, NOx, CO2e, Hg, and Pb, can be reduced across the state by 429,000, 110,000, 87,240,000, 2.21, and 4.53 pounds, respectively - all without a reduction in the electricity used in the period of study. Despite different fuel mixes, similar emissions reductions were calculated for other regions of the country, as well.

Highlights
• Residential emissions reduced through shifted timing of appliance use.
• Locational marginal prices are used to predict changes in emissions from electricity generation.
• Reductions in emissions of SO2, NOx, CO2e, Hg, and Pb from residential consumers of 12–26%.
• Significant emissions reductions are possible with a variety of fuel mixes.},

  abstract =  {A new tool is presented which analyzes the behavior of an operating electrical load in a novel manner: by automatically describing it with a finite-state model of its control structure. A personal-computer-based system is presented which collects samples of real and reactive power consumption over time, and automatically learns the control structure of the load in real time, drawing its finite-state diagram. The system also reports the load`s state at each point in time, the total time spent in each state, and total energy consumption for each of the states. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated with examples in which the multi-state operating structure of consumer appliances and other electrical systems are determined from monitored power measurements. For example, using a sensor placed at the wall plug of a refrigerator, a finite state diagram with on, off, and defrost states is automatically drawn on the computer screen. Plugging in a washing machine or dish- washer instead reveals the fill, rinse, spin, dry or other states, and how they connect with each other in that particular appliance. Statistics of state durations and energy consumption in each state are also reported. These methods can be applied to energy monitoring, fault monitoring, fault analysis, and power quality analysis of electrical machinery and systems. Another application is to extend nonintrusive load monitoring techniques to multi-state appliances. Although only tested on residential loads and consumer appliances so far, the underlying methods should also work on commercial and industrial loads, e.g., HVAC control systems.},

The algorithm is similar to the Viterbi algorithm in that it is suitable for situations in which the uncorrupted data string is generated by a known finite-state process, but it is more versatile in that it can correct a much broader class of errors. Of particular importance is the fact that the algorithm corrects common context-sensitive errors, such as symbol changes, transpositions, mergers, splits, insertions, and deletions, which may be assigned different probabilities depending on the context of preceeding and subsequent symbols. As many communication channels can be modeled in this way, this algorithm is a significant extension over the Viterbi algorithm and previous decoding techniques. The notion of channel rules is introduced to provide a framework for the user to specify the channel operation. The algorithm is given in both an off-line form and a recursive form suitable for sequentially presented data streams. In most applications, the recursive form has computational complexity only a constant times that of the Viterbi algorithm},

Electrical power quantities, harmonic load characteristics, canonical transient and steady-state waveforms are some of the typical choices of load signature or load signature basis for current research addressing appliance classification and prediction. This paper expands and evaluates appliance load signatures based on V-I trajectory-the mutual locus of instantaneous voltage and current waveforms-for precision and robustness of prediction in classification algorithms used to disaggregate residential overall energy use and predict constituent appliance profiles. We also demonstrate the use of variants of differential evolution as a novel strategy for selection of optimal load models in context of energy disaggregation. A publicly available benchmark dataset REDD is employed for evaluation purposes. Our experimental evaluations indicate that these load signatures, in conjunction with a number of popular classification algorithms, offer better or generally comparable overall precision of prediction, robustness and reliability against dynamic, noisy and highly similar load signatures with reference to electrical power quantities and harmonic content. Herein, wave-shape features are found to be an effective new basis of classification and prediction for semi-automated energy disaggregation and monitoring.},

  abstract =     {Studies were carried out using Display Energy Certificate (DEC) data for university buildings to investigate building parameters as determinants of energy use. A preliminary statistical analysis was conducted of annual electricity and heating fuel consumption across a UK-wide dataset focusing on building activity and internal environment. Using data for London university buildings only, a pilot study was also undertaken to assess the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) method for analysing a wider range of energy use determinants. For University Occupier Buildings (UOB) it was found that generally electricity use is high and heating fuel use is low relative to the CIBSE TM46 benchmarks for the University campus category. For the London university dataset there was appreciable variation in energy use between different university-specific building activities. Activity was also shown to have a high ANN causal strength together with material, environment and glazing type. Prediction performance of the ANN improved with the addition of building parameters: for electricity use the ANN mean absolute percentage error reduced to 34%, a 30% reduction relative to a theoretical benchmark-based approach; for heating fuel use it reduced to 25%, a 49% reduction against the benchmark-based approach. Prediction performance appeared to be restricted however, perhaps owing to the limited number of training patterns. From the pilot study the ANN methodology appears to be viable for use in analysing building energy use determinants. A broader follow-up study is planned accordingly and various measures to develop the ANN methodology are presented.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

With this study, we add perspective to the ongoing discussion on the sustainability of urban versus rural living and that of different housing types. We employ Household Budget Survey data from Statistics Finland and data from the Finnish Forest Research Institute (Metla) to extract the actual energy purchases and convert them into energy units. Our key findings include five perspectives: (1) behavioral differences seem significant between different housing modes; (2) each housing mode appears to be less energy-intensive in rural areas; (3) including indirect energy purchases is essential when comparing different housing modes; (4) unit-of-analysis (m2, capita, household) selection strongly affects the results; and (5) the energy mixes vary significantly between the studied building types, changing from the predominance of non-renewables in apartment buildings to that of renewables in detached houses, which in turn has interesting carbon footprint implications.},

This can provide home owners with useful feedback about how they use electrical energy, and motivate them to save significant amounts of energy. Our ultimate goal is to provide ways to modify human energy consumption behavior in order to conserve and optimize the use of energy. This paper focuses on stochastic modeling and energy disaggregation based on conditional random fields (CRFs) using real-world energy consumption data. The proposed disaggregation method uses a clustering method and histogram analysis to detect the ON/OFF states of selected types of energy-using devices in the home. Data labeling is not required, because the label sequences are obtained by applying a clustering method, and decoding using all of the data. Long spans of data from 21 households were used in a binary classification experiment, in which an 86.1% average classification accuracy was achieved. The proposed method was also evaluated using hidden Markov models (HMMs), but significantly higher accuracy was obtained when CRFs were applied.},

Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hi- erarchical processing on difficult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modelling when trained with sim- ple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales.},

Digital technologies offer an unprecedented chance to facilitate self-monitoring by delivering feedback on undesired habitual behavior. This review analyzed the results of 72 studies in which feedback from digital technology attempted to disrupt and change undesired habits. A vast majority of these studies found that feedback through digital technology is an effective way to disrupt habits, regardless of target behavior or feedback technology used. Unfortunately, methodological issues limit our confidence in the findings of all but 14 of the 50 studies with quantitative measurements in this review. Furthermore, only 4 studies tested for (and only 3 of those 4 found) sustained habit change, and it remains unclear how feedback from digital technology is moderated by receiver states and traits, as well as feedback characteristics such as feedback sign, comparison, tailoring, modality, frequency, timing and duration. We conclude with recommendations for new research directions.

Highlights
• Feedback through digital technology can disrupt undesirable habits.
• However, it remains unclear whether this disruption leads to durable habit change.
• The effect of feedback characteristics and user states and traits remain understudied.
• Findings from this review can be used to inform the development of feedback-based products.},

Household energy consumption behaviours, however, span a spectrum from reasoned and deliberate to unplanned and automatic. The aim of this paper is to advance knowledge of reasoned and unplanned behaviours in the context of pro-environmental action. Using results of a survey administered to occupants of an urban residential green building, this study explores five household consumption behaviours and tests the hypothesis that unplanned behaviours will be poorly predicted by a reasoned, values-based behavioural framework. Using path analyses, variables in a values-based framework are used to predict surveyed behaviours. Findings indicate that behaviours hypothesized to be unplanned were not well predicted by the values-based framework. The framework successfully predicted what was hypothesized to be a fully reasoned behaviour. Three potential reasons are discussed for the lack of prediction of some behaviours. A deeper understanding of how unplanned, automatic or habitual behaviours intervene in conservation intentions can help policy-makers and building designers better respond to influences of occupant behaviour on building performance.},

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse.

  abstract =     {This work presents a two-stage model for the data analysis of electricity consumption. The first stage divides the consumption in two parts: weather- and illumination-related, and residual consumption, where weather-related consumption refers to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). Given the hourly total consumption, we obtain the hourly weather-related and illumination-related electricity consumption, and subtract this out to get residual consumption. The second stage of the model is a flexible, agent-based analytical tool that allows disaggregation of residual consumption into a sum of consumptions by different groups of appliances. This tool can be used for a variety of applications including an optimization of demand-side management and/or a development of a set of desirable patterns for schedules of electricity-related activities in households (within an acceptable range of course) in order to minimize negative effects of high peak demand.},

We review events exhibiting evidence for elevated atmospheric CO2, global warming, and ocean acidification over the past ~300 million years of Earth’s history, some with contemporaneous extinction or evolutionary turnover among marine calcifiers. Although similarities exist, no past event perfectly parallels future projections in terms of disrupting the balance of ocean carbonate chemistry—a consequence of the unprecedented rapidity of CO2 release currently taking place.},

Key features are the time-variant thermal resistances, associated with the heat extraction due to airflow, calculated using an airflow network model. This approach was validated with experimental data collected in a two-zone test-building under four operation modes. A forward linear time-variant state-space (LTV-SS) model, developed based on first principles, was then used as a true representation of the building, to identify the parameters of a low-order LTV-SS gray-box model. The low-order model can predict the building thermal dynamics with sufficient accuracy with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.58 °C for the air and 1.08 °C for the area-weighted mean surface temperature in the south direct gain zone. Furthermore, the study develops a progressive refinement (ProRe) optimization method, following the multi-level optimization topology and branch and bound decision trimming strategy, to find sequences of binary (open/close) decisions for the motorized windows. Due to the significant improvement in computing time, the models and algorithms presented in this paper enable long-term simulation for MPC performance evaluation and implementation of predictive strategies in real controllers.},

Converting these measurements to knowledge that can improve energy efficiency in the residential sector is critical to attract further smart grid investments and engage electricity consumers in the path towards reducing global carbon footprint. The goal of the reported research is to use smart meter measurement data to identify heating and cooling usage levels for a home. This is important to cost effectively design consumer energy services such as energy audit and demand response targeted towards improving an individual household's heating usage efficiency. We present a machine learning approach akin to Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) to disaggregate heating usage from measurements of a household's total electricity usage. We use as input 15-minute interval meter data and hourly outdoor temperature measurements. Our approach does not require a manual set-up procedure at each house. The method uses a Hidden Markov Model to capture the dependence of heating usage on outdoor temperature. Compared to existing methods based on linear regression, the proposed method provides details on heating usage patterns and is more flexible to incorporate other system specific information. Preliminary results based on synthetic and real-world usage data demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

This virtual supply of energy generates multiple benefits for governments, businesses and households, including greater energy security from reduced dependence on energy imports and billions of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions reductions. 

Strengthening our understanding of the energy efficiency market and the prospects over the medium term is becoming increasingly important. The 2015 Energy Efficiency Market Report (EEMR) evaluates the impact of energy efficiency in the energy system and assesses the scale and outlook for further energy efficiency investment using detailed country-by-country energy efficiency indicator data and IEA expertise. 

This year’s report includes an in-depth look into the buildings energy efficiency market and the electricity sector. Energy efficiency investments in the buildings sector totalled between USD 90 billion in 2014. In the electricity sector, energy efficiency has proved critical in flattening electricity consumption in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries, driving utilities to adapt their business models. 

Promoting and expanding energy efficiency markets is a worldwide phenomenon, and EEMR 2015 presents a number of case studies at the national, state and municipal level. These include examinations of Latin America’s two largest economies, Brazil and Mexico, which are looking to efficiency to boost productivity and social development. Energy-exporting countries like Saudi Arabia and the Russian Federation are also increasingly turning to efficiency to increase exports and reduce the costs of growing domestic energy consumption. In addition to national governments, major urban areas such as Tokyo, Seoul and Paris are increasingly enabling energy efficiency investment.},

  abstract =   {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

The study puts into evidence that the benefit that can be drawn from the installation of BAC and TBM systems depends on the type of technical appliances in the household and on the starting energy performance class. Finally, the economic impact due to the introduction of BACS or TBM function is evaluated for different starting energy classes of the household under consideration.

While HA protocols include basic monitoring functions, extreme bandwidth limitations (<180bps) have prevented their use in load monitoring. In this paper, we highlight challenges in designing AutoMeter, a system for exploiting HA for accurate load monitoring at scale. We quantify Insteon's limitations to query device status---once every 10 seconds to achieve less than 5% loss rate---and then evaluate techniques to disaggregate coarse HA data from fine-grained building-wide power data. In particular, our techniques learn switched load power using on-off-dim events, and tag fine-grained building-wide power data using readings from plug meters every 5 minutes.},

  abstract =     {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) provides homeowners with detailed feedback on their electricity usage, but an open area is appliance labeling and generalizable appliance models that can be trained in one home and deployed in another. We therefore propose a semi-supervised learning appliance annotation scheme for home appliance signatures (SARAA). SARAA utilizes time series of appliance turn on and turn off events to tune generic appliance classifiers to appliances in the target home using a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data. Achieving this goal requires the development of a stopping criterion for semi-supervised learning, and we propose and evaluate a stopping heuristic for one-nearest neighbor semi-supervised learning of appliance signature time series. Starting with only a single labeled instance in the target home, SARAA produces classifiers with median F1 scores only 14.8% lower than benchmark classifiers trained on the fully labeled ground truth data in the target home, outperforming classifiers trained only on data from other homes, which have a median F1 score that is 51.23% poorer than the benchmark. The results of this paper will help develop NILM systems, which can automatically learn appliance signatures without user input and facilitate wider adoption of NILM technologies.},

Smart home enable us to achieve comfort, safety, security and energy consumption in a home environment. The objective of our work is to extend Smart home environment by introducing a service called centralized controller. Nowadays electricity in several areas is circulated due to the low availability of electricity. So we propose a scheme to operate the home devices in a time where electricity is present even though user is not present inside the home. The area in which the Smart home is present power will be circulated so in our proposed design we set two ways to provide power to the devices in a smart home. One is ordinary electrical line and another one is any form of alternative source like photovoltaic or windmill. The Centralized controller will play a major role by scheduling the devices present inside home to be operated in a particular time period in which the electricity is available and also it will altering the energy source from the electrical line to alternative source photovoltaic or windmill. Our system will enable the user to access the entire device present inside the Smart home from outside through a secured message transmission way.},

  abstract =     {Enforcing security in Internet of Things environments has been identified as one of the top barriers for realizing the vision of smart, energy-efficient homes and buildings. In this context, understanding the risks related to the use and potential misuse of information about homes, partners, and end-users, as well as, forming methods for integrating security-enhancing measures in the design is not straightforward and thus requires substantial investigation. A risk analysis applied on a smart home automation system developed in a research project involving leading industrial actors has been conducted. Out of 32 examined risks, 9 were classified as low and 4 as high, i.e., most of the identified risks were deemed as moderate. The risks classified as high were either related to the human factor or to the software components of the system. The results indicate that with the implementation of standard security features, new, as well as, current risks can be minimized to acceptable levels albeit that the most serious risks, i.e., those derived from the human factor, need more careful consideration, as they are inherently complex to handle. A discussion of the implications of the risk analysis results points to the need for a more general model of security and privacy included in the design phase of smart homes. With such a model of security and privacy in design in place, it will contribute to enforcing system security and enhancing user privacy in smart homes, and thus helping to further realize the potential in such IoT environments.

Highlights
• Smart home automation systems introduce security and user privacy risks.
• A risk analysis of a smart home automation system is designed and conducted.
• 32 risks are identified, of which four are classified as severe and 19 as moderate.
• The severe risks are related to the software components, as well as human behavior.
• It is concluded that security and privacy should be integrated in the design phase.},

The concept of EnergyLife takes into account state-of-the-art knowledge of what makes a
feedback intervention effective, which – at this stage of its development – can be
synthesized into two main features. First, knowledge and action are to be synergically
addressed by visualizing electricity consumption on the one side, and providing conservation
tips on the other. Second, the design should be centered on the users and undergo iterative
usability tests. A more detailed description of the literature-based requirements informing the
design of EnergyLife is offered at the beginning of the paper. The way in which they are
embodied in the features of the mobile interface, epitomized by its intuitive 3D carousel, is
then described. Finally, the rationale and results of the first usability evaluation are reported,
describing the responses to a satisfaction questionnaire and the types of breakdowns that
occurred during the users’ interaction with the device. These results will guide the next

This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.},

Yet, the interface design aspect of these systems has largely been ignored. Therefore, the role that interface design plays at the component level in driving actual energy savings from users is unclear. In this paper, we evaluate the impact interface design has on eco-feedback performance by investigating five established design components. We conducted a six week empirical study with 43 participants using a prototype eco-feedback interface. Analysis of usage data affirmed a statistically significant inverse correlation between user engagement (measured as logins) and energy consumption. Utilizing this relationship as a basis for performance, we expanded our analysis to evaluate the five design components. The study revealed statistically significant evidence corroborating that historical comparison and incentives are design components that drive higher engagement and thus reductions in energy consumption. Results for the normative comparison and disaggregation components were inconclusive, while results for the rewards and penalization component suggest that a revision to the penalization aspect of the component may be necessary. This study raises pertinent questions regarding the efficacy of various eco-feedback components in eliciting energy savings.},

A non-intrusive load disaggregation approach for lighting systems in office buildings was proposed and evaluated to provide high granularity spatiotemporal load monitoring. In our approach, we proposed a process for artificial light event detection and power consumption estimation using light intensity signals and rooms’ contextual information (i.e. room area and number of possible states for lighting fixtures). Three event detection algorithms: generalized likelihood ratio test, signal-shape driven event detection, and enhanced naïve event detection were proposed and evaluated. The signal-shape driven event detection algorithm outperformed on data collected in rooms where the natural light was used in conjunction with artificial light source. The correlation between the illuminance in a room and power consumption associated with that level of illuminance was used for power consumption estimation. The evaluations in rooms (with and without natural light) showed the feasibility of accurate power estimation when the sensor is installed closer to the floor and the estimation is informed by the possible operating states of lighting fixtures.},

However, the difficulty associated with obtaining training data sets for the commonly used supervised NILM classification algorithms is a major obstacle in wide commercial adoption of the technology. The diversity of electrical load signatures (patterns of appliances' power draw) demands in-situ training (labeling of the signatures), which often needs to be performed by ordinary users through user-system interaction. To produce the example signatures required for training, continuous interaction with users might be required, which could reduce the success of the training process due to user fatigue. Pre-populating the training data set could help facilitate the process by reducing the number of user-system interactions needed for labeling. Taking into consideration all the issues described above, a study to test the feasibility of autonomous clustering of similar appliances' signatures based on hierarchical clustering was investigated. The information contained in the structure of the binary cluster tree was used for clustering without the need for a priori selection of the number of clusters. The assessment, carried out on data collected from a residential setting, showed promising results (with accuracy above 90%, calculated based on the ground truth labels) supporting the feasibility of the approach for unsupervised clustering.},

2°C, with around 65% of global emissions covered
INDCs announced by 1 September 2015 lead to global emissions far above the levels
needed by 2025 and 2030 to put the world on track to hold warming below 2°C, or to below
1.5°C, in 2100.
As of 1st September, 29 INDC submissions have been received, reflecting 56 countries
(including the European Union member states), and covering around 65% of global
emissions in 2010 (excluding LULUCF) and 43% of global population. The CAT has directly
assessed 16 of these INDCs covering 64.5% of global emissions in 2010 (excluding LULUCF)
and 41% of global population.
With the INDCs submitted to date, the CAT projects total global emissions are on track to
be 53-57 GtCO2e in 2025 and 55-59 GtCO2e in 2030, far above the least-cost global
pathways consistent with limiting warming below 2°C. Additional reductions in the order of
12-15 GtO2e by 2025 and of 17-21 GtCO2e by 2030 are needed for global emissions to be
consistent with a 2°C pathway.
INDCs are yet to come from 140 countries. The ten highest emitters yet to submit INDCs
are India, Brazil, Iran, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and
Pakistan, together accounting for 18% of global emissions not yet covered by INDCs
(excluding LULUCF).
Aside from the insufficient ambition of the aggregate INDCs, there is a significant gap
between current policies and the INDCs: global emissions under currently implemented
policies are projected to be higher than the already inadequate INDC levels. Some countries
propose INDCs close to the current trajectory giving confidence that they are met (e.g. EU
and China). Others have put forward a target that would be a significant change in trend, but these are not yet supported by any significant existing legislation, e.g. Australia and
Canada, raising questions about the likely implementation. Yet others are showing progress
in policy implementation, continuously moving their future trajectories downwards, but
policies are not yet sufficient to meet their (still inadequate) INDCs (e.g. USA).
The gap between pledges and policies increases through time, highlighting the need for
long-term policy action. This is not to underplay the significance and importance of
governments putting in place policies that will actually reduce their emissions, but for many
governments this is not yet the case.},

In a randomized controlled trial, residential electricity customers are exposed to price increases, with some households also receiving displays that transmit high-frequency information about usage and prices. This substantially lowers information acquisition costs and allows us to identify the marginal information effect. Households only experiencing price increases reduce demand by 0 to 7 percent whereas those also exposed to information feedback exhibit a usage reduction of 8 to 22 percent, depending on the amount of advance notice. The differential response across treatments is significant and robust to the awareness of price changes. Conservation extends beyond the treatment window, providing evidence of habit formation, spillovers, and greenhouse gas abatement. Results suggest that information about the quantity consumed facilitates learning, which likely drives the treatment differential.},

The author presents an empirical relation between annual sea-ice extent and global atmospheric CO2 concentrations, in which sea-ice reductions are line-arly, inversely proportional to the magnitude of increase of CO2 over the last few decades. This approximates sea-ice changes during the most recent four decades, with a proportionality constant of 0.030 million km2 per ppmv CO2. When applied to future emission scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), this relationship results in substantially faster ice decreases up to 2050 than predicted by IPCC models. However, depar-tures from this projection may arise from non-linear feedback effects and/or temporary natural variations on interannual timescales, such as the record minimum of sea-ice extent observed in September 2007.},

  abstract =     {There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the ubiquitous Hidden Markov Model for learning from sequential and time-series data. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi-Markov modeling, which has been developed mainly in the parametric non-Bayesian setting, to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations.

In this paper we introduce the explicit-duration Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden semi-Markov Model (HDP-HSMM) and develop sampling algorithms for efficient posterior inference. The methods we introduce also provide new methods for sampling inference in the finite Bayesian HSMM. Our modular Gibbs sampling methods can be embedded in samplers for larger hierarchical Bayesian models, adding semi-Markov chain modeling as another tool in the Bayesian inference toolbox. We demonstrate the utility of the HDP-HSMM and our inference methods on both synthetic and real experiments.},

Standard HMMs are easily implemented with off-the-shelf tools, whereas duration models require substantial algorithmic development and have higher computational costs when implemented, suggesting that a simple adjustment to HMM topologies is perhaps a more efficient solution to the problem of duration than more complex approaches.},

The results from the tests revealed that all the case study dwellings performed very close to that predicted. This is in contrast with other work that has been undertaken regarding the performance of the building fabric, which indicates that a very wide range of performance exists in new-build dwellings in the UK, and that the difference between the measured and predicted fabric performance can be greater than 100%. Despite the small non-random size of the sample, the results suggest that careful design coupled with the implementation of appropriate quality control systems, such as those required to attain Passivhaus Certification, may be conducive to delivering dwellings that begin to ‘bridge the gap’ between measured and predicted fabric performance.},

Thus, we developed a smart meter prototype with a high sampling frequency, which allows for continuous measurement of the current and voltage from three-phase power lines.

By exploiting this structure in learning, robots can obtain state representations consistent with the aspects of physics relevant to the learning task. We name this prior knowledge about the structure of interactions with the physical world robotic priors. We identify five robotic priors and explain how they can be used to learn pertinent state representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in simulated and real robotic experiments with distracting moving objects. We show that our method extracts task-relevant state representations from high-dimensional observations, even in the presence of task-irrelevant distractions. We also show that the state representations learned by our method greatly improve generalization in reinforcement learning.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach to estimate a building's demand response capacity using detailed data from various sensors installed in a building. We derive a formula for a probabilistic measure that characterizes various tradeoffs between the available demand response capacity and the confidence level associated with that curtailment under the constraints of building occupant comfort level (or utility). Then, we develop a data-driven framework to associate observed or projected building energy consumption with a particular set of rules learned from a large sensor dataset. We apply this methodology using testbeds in two buildings in Singapore: a unique net-zero energy building and a modern commercial office building. Our experimental results identify key control parameters and provide insight into the available demand response strategies at each site.},

is a key enabler of important advanced services for smart grids.
With wide deployments of smart meters, there is a growing
interest in using Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) to
acquire this information from the meter measurements. However,
electrical signatures extracted from utility-side smart meters are
often unreliable for NILM due to their large sampling intervals.
This paper presents a new approach of using high-frequency
current waveforms sampled periodically at a main branch to
track reliably the on/off states of appliances in real-time. We
develop an incremental training algorithm and a robust detection
algorithm for the harmonic signatures, based on semi-supervised
learning and a hidden Markov model, respectively. We evaluate
the performance of the training and detection algorithms using
simulations and a proof-of-concept testbed with five appliances.
The simulation results show that our state detection algorithm
is highly robust against noisy harmonic signatures – up to 16
times more robust than a baseline algorithm without the hidden
Markov model. The experimental results show that the proposed
algorithms can successfully learn most harmonic signatures using
only 10% of label information. They can detect the on/off states
with less than 4 % errors.},

average statistics.
This concept is (presently) being extended with actual
measurements (15 min. values on the main meter) starting
with 3 000 households. Furthermore new technology has
been developed that combines a small power meter with a
communication system through power lines and Internet
Protocol technology – allowing automatic measurements of
individual appliances or groups of appliances and the main
meter. Furthermore, the concept is now being developed for
larger buildings as a whole and for specific consumption areas
e.g. lighting and ventilation.
The aim is to set up an electronic advisory service based
on specific inputs and measurements from the users’ (real)
life. The concept is that the more you put in to the system
the more qualified feedback you get. The concept will be
serving as basis for professional service providers such as
ventilation companies, utilities and others. Various advisory
providers lack a specific entrance to their potential costumers
where they on basis of individual experiences, consumption
and behaviour offer the customer real added value.
The huge amount of data automatically collected on various
consumptions with corresponding appliance stocks will
provide knowledge/data including usage patterns to a degree
never seen before. This paper will briefly describe the
strategy and technical solutions and present various analyses
of the actual usage, responses and potential savings.},

However, relatively little work has been done on the best ways to present information in order to maximise energy savings. In this work, different ways of presenting feedback on electricity consumption were systematically analysed and user interface prototypes were developed based on the analysis. The prototypes were shown to consumers in qualitative interviews to gain information on how well they understood them and what kind of feedback they prefer to receive on their electricity consumption. The results show that the following features of feedback on electricity consumption are most valued by consumers: presentations of costs (over a period of time), appliance-specific breakdown, i.e. information on what proportion is consumed by each appliance, and historical comparison, i.e. comparison with their own prior consumption.},

In addition to these variables, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption, as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19 and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level, home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption.},

In the past decade, the viability of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies has been demonstrated, leading to increased possibilities for novel services for building energy management. This development has resulted in numerous approaches being proposed for harnessing WSNs for energy management and conservation.

  abstract =    {Wise management of electricity consumption is becoming increasingly important. Domestic electricity
prices in the UK increased by 35% over the past 8 years; an upward trend which is unlikely
to reverse any time soon. As well as the economic costs, the environmental problems associated
with the combustion of fossil fuels are becoming increasingly detrimental to the well-being of many
species, including our own.
One of the cheapest and easiest ways to improve energy eciency is to monitor one's electricity
consumption using a type of smart meter called a \home energy monitor" available for around £40.
These display whole-house consumption in real-time, allowing the user to learn which devices and
behaviours consume the most energy. Studies have demonstrated that the feedback provided by
energy monitors can enable users to reduce consumption by 5-15 %. If every domestic user in the
UK reduced electricity consumption by 10% then the UK's annual CO2 output would be reduced
by 6 million tonnes. However, the information displayed by home energy monitors is not as useful
as it could be.
Home energy monitors measure aggregate consumption for an entire building. Research has
demonstrated that disaggregated information describing appliance-by-appliance energy consumption
is more eective than aggregate information. Disaggregation was rst successfully implemented
in the 1980s using sophisticated smart meters which provide rich, multi-dimensional raw sensor
data. However, these sophisticated meters are not readily available at present.
The main contribution of this project is to design, implement and evaluate three dierent algorithms
for disaggregating the sparse, one-dimensional data output by inexpensive, popular and
readily available home energy monitors. Each design is trained to recognise a device on the basis
of one or more raw recordings of single-device power consumption (which we call signatures). The
system is then given an unseen aggregate signal from which it must infer the start times, run
duration and energy consumption of each device activation present in the aggregate data.
The rst design is a simple prototype which uses a least mean squares approach to matching
a signature to an aggregate signal. As expected, this design succeeds only in a very limited set
of contexts but the development of this prototype provided valuable insights. The second design
represents a novel approach to determining a set of device power states by identifying peaks in the
histogram of the device's signature but this design proved to not be ideal.
The nal design presented in this dissertation represents a novel approach to disaggregation
whereby each device is modelled as a power state graph. Each graph vertex (node) represents a
power state and each edge represents the conditions necessary to transition from the source to the
destination power state. During disaggregation, every possible \t" of the power state graph to
the aggregate data is represented as a tree structure where each tree vertex represents a power
state and each tree edge represents the likelihood for the corresponding power state transition. For
each complete \t" of the power state graph to the aggregate data, the disaggregation algorithm
reports the start time, the average likelihood, the estimated run time and the estimated total energy
consumption. This design has several attractive features: 1) it handles both simple devices and
complex devices whose signatures contain power state sequences which repeat an arbitrary number
of times; 2) it is probabilistic; 3) a power state graph can be learnt from one or more signatures
and 4) the design estimates the energy consumed by each device activation.
This design was evaluated by training it to recognise four real devices: a toaster, a kettle, a
washing machine and a tumble drier. The system was then given 13 days of real aggregate data.
For all devices except the tumble drier it detected every device activation in the aggregate data
although there were a few false positives. The system failed to model the tumble drier, possibly
because the drier has very rapid state transitions.},

We use seven metrics to test the performance of these algorithms on real aggregate power data from five appliances. Tests are performed against a house not seen during training and against houses seen during training. We find that all three neural nets achieve better F1 scores (averaged over all five appliances) than either combinatorial optimisation or factorial hidden Markov models and that our neural net algorithms generalise well to an unseen house.},

To conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the ‘ground truth’ demand of individual appliances. In this context, we present UK-DALE: an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity at a sample rate of 16 kHz for the whole-house and at 1/6 Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from five houses, one of which was recorded for 655 days, the longest duration we are aware of for any energy dataset at this sample rate.

A structural equation model (SEM) is introduced to calculate the magnitude and significance of explanatory variables on residential energy consumption. The benefit of this approach is that it explains the complex relationships that exist between manifest variables and their overall effect though direct, indirect and total effects. Using the English House Condition Survey (EHCS) consisting of 2531 unique cases, the main drivers behind residential energy consumption are found to be the number of household occupants, floor area, household income, dwelling efficiency (SAP), household heating patterns and living room temperature. In the multivariate case, SAP explains very little of the variance of residential energy consumption. However, this procedure fails to account for simultaneity bias between energy consumption and SAP. Using SEM its shown that dwelling energy efficiency (SAP), has reciprocal causality with dwelling energy consumption and the magnitude of these two effects are calculable. When non-recursivity between SAP and energy consumption is allowed for, SAP is shown to have a negative effect on energy consumption but conversely, homes with a propensity to consume more energy also have higher SAP rates.},

We analyze their measurements of monthly consumption, changes through time, comparison of appliances, and length of payback period. Because of systematic errors in quantification, consumers choose ineffective energy conservation actions, and underestimate the benefits of previous actions. These errors do not result solely from lack of information since they are made even by consumers who understand technical energymeasurement. To explain the persistence of a seemingly disadvantageous system, we show that consumer methods are cognitively efficient. They are easy to learn and use and are compatible with general-purpose budgeting tasks. However, they lead to higher energy use than would be economically optimal for either the individual or the nation.},

We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimising a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalised likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favourably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies we show that our new method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative exact methods. We also compare with the Binary Segmentation algorithm for identifying changepoints, showing that the exactness of our approach can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the data.},

In contrast with the majority of the existing approaches to solve this problem which require training, here we explore an unsupervised approach to determine the number of appliances in the household, their power consumption and state, at any given moment. We attempt to achieve this without using any a priori information on the number and type of appliances. Our approach is to first create clusters of steady-state changes and then employ a matching pursuit algorithm to reconstruct the original power signals using the clusters that were found as the sources in a linear blind source separation strategy. Changes in steady-state, sometimes referred to as events, are characterized by their change in real and reactive power (P and Q). Ultimately, the results may be applied to other features in an attempt to improve the separation between clusters. The preliminary results point toward a mixed scenario: large appliances (roughly above 400W) were easily identified, but the small appliances typically clustered together and were difficult to separate. We conclude that the errors occur during clustering which indicates that, in order to increase the purity of the clusters, perhaps other features could be used.},

Even a moderate reduction in this sector results in significant monetary and resource savings. Fine-grained resource monitoring is regarded as one technology that could help consumers and building owners to understand, and thus reduce, their resource waste. In this paper, we discuss challenges emerging from these fine grained resource monitoring systems through an empirical study of long-term monitoring data of a residential space. We collected synchronous water and electricity usage over 3 months from a single family house. Using a matched filter mechanism we detect several water and electrical events happening in the house, showing that with simple mathematical tools, these data traces reveal already a lot of information about the consumption patterns. We further discuss challenges in fine grained load monitoring using the main power meter, advocating that synchronous water and power traces help to disambiguate several power consumers. In addition, our analysis revealed interesting privacy implications while monitoring a household's resource consumption at high time resolution, a problem that could easily hamper the successful adaptation of these technologies.},

We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder.

Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network.

  abstract =    {Energy consumption from Miscellaneous Energy Loads (MELs) in Residential buildings is growing faster than any
other end use category and has offset some of the efficiency gains made in lighting, HVAC, and water heating (EIA
2013). Historically, it has been difficult to develop precise estimates of MEL energy use, and the highly distributed
nature of MEL energy use makes it time-consuming and expensive to collect meaningful data across the wide
number of end uses. While there are a wide range of studies that estimate energy consumption for individual
MELs, it is difficult to evaluate their relative uncertainty without an in-depth review of study methodology. From a
ZNE planning perspective, understanding the relative confidence in MEL estimates is critical.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative certainty of existing estimates by conducting a literature
review of existing MEL studies and to identify their underlying respective methodologies. Due to the limited scope
of this study, it does not include original, primary research on MEL energy use or significant manipulation of
existing study data. Based on this information, we identify best available estimates, identify gaps in existing
information, and develop recommendations for future study. In addition, this report provides an overview of
alternative methods of estimating energy use and load disaggregation techniques using Non-Intrusive Load
Monitoring (NILM), which has the potential to improve accuracy and lower the costs of estimating MEL energy use.
It is important to note that this literature review is, by nature, a backward looking study, and does not reflect the
most up-to-date usage or energy consumption of new devices coming to market; rather, it is a review of existing
estimates to clarify the uncertainty of existing data and identify best available information for existing stock.},

Many NILM algorithms have been developed in the past but a well-founded comparison was impossible. This is due to the fact that it is very hard to generate suitable data sets. In this paper we describe one way to achieve this with very low effort. Furthermore we define several numbers for judging on the quality of NILM algorithms allowing for an easier comparison. They are a basis for our future work with NILM systems.},

  abstract =  {Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason—to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. 

Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.},

Studies have shown that having device-level energy information can cause users to conserve significant amounts of energy, but current electricity meters only report whole-home data. Thus, developing algorithmic methods for disaggregation presents a key technical challenge in the effort to maximize energy conservation. In this paper, we examine a large scale energy disaggregation task, and apply a novel extension of sparse coding to this problem. In particular, we develop a method, based upon structured prediction, for discriminatively training sparse coding algorithms specifically to maximize disaggregation performance. We show that this significantly improves the performance of sparse coding algorithms on the energy task and illustrate how these disaggregation results can provide useful information about energy usage.},

  abstract =  {This paper considers additive factorial hidden Markov models, an extension to HMMs where the state factors into multiple independent chains, and the output is an additive function of all the hidden states. Although such models are very powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly susceptible to local optima. In this paper we propose an alternative inference method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a "robust" mixture component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time. Combining these elements we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing approaches in practice. The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate signal.},

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have the ability, in theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the short-term memory implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections. However, in practice they are difficult to train successfully when the long-term memory is required. This paper introduces a simple, yet powerful modification to the standard RNN architecture, the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations only at its prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more complex, CW-RNN reduces the number of RNN parameters, improves the performance significantly in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The network is demonstrated in preliminary experiments involving two tasks: audio signal generation and TIMIT spoken word classification, where it outperforms both RNN and LSTM networks.},

In this paper, we are able to evolve extremely small recurrent neural network (RNN) controllers for a task that previously required networks with over a million weights. The high-dimensional visual input, which the controller would normally receive, is first transformed into a compact feature vector through a deep, max-pooling convolutional neural network (MPCNN). Both the MPCNN preprocessor and the RNN controller are evolved successfully to control a car in the TORCS racing simulator using only visual input.

These devices have the potential to provide the kind of personalized feedback necessary to effect behavioral change among residential consumers. However, for consumers to be able to act on the information provided on IHDs, they must first be able to understand it. We present an approach to in-home display design that uses research on customer preferences to determine which features to experimentally examine for customer comprehension. Additionally, we compare these preferences against experimental data to determine whether people have insight into what information best works for an increased understanding of energy saving. Using a computer-based simulated IHD, we find that the types of feedback information that consumers prefer (appliance-specific and dollar-feedback) are not as effective for learning about appliance energy use as the less-preferred aggregated kW h feedback. Moreover, it appears that a simpler more generalized format of information provision has the potential to be more effective than a personalized IHD. We discuss how consumer preferences and experimental tests can jointly be used to inform the design of feedback technologies.

• In-home display design approach incorporating customer preferences and experimental evidence.
• A computer-based simulated display to experimentally test feedback information.
• Contrast of customer feedback information preferences with experimental evidence.
• Appliance-specific/dollar feedback is not as effective as aggregated kW h feedback.
• Generalized information feedback may be more effective than a personalized display.},

This model has attractive statistical and computational properties and yields explicit recursive formulas for the Bayes estimates of the piecewise constant parameters. Efficient estimators of the hyperparameters of the Bayesian model for the parameter jumps can be used in conjunction, yielding empirical Bayes estimates. The empirical Bayes approach is also applied to solve long-standing frequentist problems such as significance testing of the null hypothesis of no change-points versus multiple change-point alternatives, and inference on the number and locations of change-points that partition the unknown parameter sequence into segments of equal values. Simulation studies of performance and an illustrative application to the British coal mine data are also given. Extensions from the exponential family to general parametric families and from independent observations to genearlized linear time series models are then provided.},

  abstract =    {Advanced utility meters (so-called “smart meters”) coupled with in-home displays or feedback devices provide the means by which residential energy consumers can become more knowledgeable about their energy consumption practices. Such devices, in effect, enable consumers to become active managers of their own energy resource use, or in this case their home electricity usage patterns. Indeed, one extensive ACEEE meta-review of 57 different feedback programs indicates a 4 to 12 percent range of residential electricity savings on average across an international sample – depending on the technologies employed, the characteristics of the program, and other relevant factors.

At the same time, however, few studies have explored the scale of investment or larger impacts that might accompany the growth and successful implementation of feedback programs. Nor have they examined the economy-wide benefits that might accrue from the systematic integration of feedback-induced energy savings over time. This report provides some initial estimates of the larger macroeconomic outcomes of feedback programs. In effect, it asks the question: what might the success of these programs imply for the larger economy as a whole?  Using a Monte Carlo modeling exercise to evaluate five different scenarios, the analysis finds feedback programs to be highly cost-effective with a net savings of $2-3 for every dollar expended.  Depending on the range of assumptions, the program expenditures and residential electricity bill savings are shown to support an average annual increase of 6,000 to 56,000 net jobs over the period 2012 through 2050.},

As but one example, the second annual Behavior, Energy, and Climate Conference (co-convened by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, the Precourt Institute for Energy Efficiency, and the California Institute for Energy and Environment) exceeded capacity almost six weeks before the November 2008 conference date (see, for example, the conference website at http://www.BECCconference.org). At the same time, many analysts suggest that, yes, behaviour-oriented programs provide a nice way to help deploy smart technologies but that they are, essentially, boutique or niche strategies; they can only help round out a technology-based deployment effort. We suggest to the contrary; elements of the behaviour or human dimension may have a surprising scale which rivals a pure technology-based perspective in terms of expected efficiency gains.

In this paper we highlight the potential impact of changed habits, lifestyles and technology-based behaviours in terms of potential energy savings within the United States for the residential sector. We explore the level of potential savings along what we call a Behaviour Energy Response Continuum. In other words, we explore the energy savings if different motivations and habits drove a different behaviour, and if different lifestyles similarly drove a different behaviour as they all, in turn, affect energy consumption. Preliminary research suggests that changed behaviours might reduce household use of energy by about 22 percent within the United States. In this paper we characterize the elements along this behaviour continuum, estimate the potential impact, and describe potential next steps in the needed research.},

Load signatures can be applied to produce many useful services and products, such as, determining the energy usage of individual appliances, monitoring the health of critical equipment, monitoring power quality, and developing facility management tools. Load signatures of typical yet extensive loads are needed to be collected before applying them to different services and products. As there are an enormous number of electrical appliances, it is beneficial to classify the appliances for building a well-organized load signature database. The objective of this study is to develop an effective method to classify the loads. A 2-dimensional form of load signatures, voltage-current (V-l) trajectory, is suggested for characterizing the typical household appliances.Hierarchical clustering method was employed to classify the appliances and construct the taxonomy of the appliances. The taxonomy based on V-l trajectory was compared to the taxonomies based on traditional power metrics and eigenvectors in the previous studies. It was found that the groups of appliances in the taxonomy based on V-I trajectory were well-separated and had engineering meanings .},

However, an RBM typically does not provide a tractable distribution estimator, since evaluating the probability it assigns to some given observation requires the computation of the so-called partition function, which itself is intractable for RBMs of even moderate size. Our model circumvents this difficulty by decomposing the joint distribution of observations into tractable conditional distributions and modeling each conditional using a non-linear function similar to a conditional of an RBM. Our model can also be interpreted as an autoencoder wired such that its output can be used to assign valid probabilities to observations. We show that this new model outperforms other multivariate binary distribution estimators on several datasets and performs similarly to a large (but intractable) RBM.},

NILM is an ideal platform for extracting useful information about any system that uses electromechanical devices. It has a low installation cost and high reliability because it uses a bare minimum of sensors. It is possible to use modem state and parameter estimation algorithms to verify remotely the "health" of electromechanical loads by using NILM to analyze measured waveforms associated with the operation of individual loads. NILM can also monitor the operation of the electrical distribution system itself, identifying situations where two or more otherwise healthy loads interfere with each other's operation through voltage waveform distortion or power quality problems. Strategies for nonintrusive monitoring have developed over the last 20 years. Advances in computing technology make a new wealth of computational tools useful in practical, field-based NILM systems. This article reviews techniques for high-performance nonintrusive load and diagnostic monitoring and illustrates key points with results from field tests.},

  abstract =    {Obtaining high quality information economically and reliably is always a difficult objective to achieve. The electric power industry and consumers recently face many challenges, such as deregulation, autonomous power systems and power quality. The knowledge of the nature and state of the power systems will undoubtedly be the key in meeting these challenges. The Non-Intrusive Power Monitor is a novel attempt to collect such information with a minimal physical installation. Raw voltage and current are measured at a single location to yield harmonic power signals. They typically carry the fingerprints of the electric loads present in a system, and their analysis can produce such information as the operational and diagnostic status of the loads. The power signals can also be used for the system identification, parameter estimation and energy consumption optimization study. In this research, the power signals are mostly modeled as stochastic processes and various detection, estimation and pattern recognition algorithms are developed to extract desired information. A constant load status identifier is developed in this thesis which can identify the ON and OFF status of electric loads, both from their steady-state power consumptions and transient patterns. The identifier can also classify multiple load events occurring at a same time and estimate states without load events. The power consumed by a variable speed drive is also estimated using the correlations between the fundamental powers and higher harmonic powers. The harmonic signal generated by the imbalance of a rotating machine is estimated to monitor the drive, i.e. its speed and magnitude of the imbalance. The algorithms are thoroughly tested using the data collected at real buildings, and some of them are implemented on-line.(cont.) This thesis focuses on developing mathematical models and signal processing algorithms for the customers at the end of the AC distribution system. Its results will directly benefit the developments of a ubiquitous electric meter in a deregulated market, a diagnostic or prognostic tool for mission-critical systems and an intelligent power quality monitor.},

  abstract =     {Success of strategies for solving problems of climate change, resource efficiency and environmental impacts increasingly depend on whether changes in public behaviour can and will supplement the technical solutions available to date. A renewed perspective on existing policy tools and potential strategies for behaviour change are entering public debate that have implications for behaviour of individuals, but that also raise critical questions about the role of the government in the society and transition to sustainability. The guiding question is whether it is possible to help individuals make better decisions for themselves and society at large by overcoming limitations of human cognitive capacity and behavioural biases? In order to answer these questions, this article 1) analyses existing academic knowledge on nudging and choice architecture; 2) investigates lessons about effectiveness of applied nudging tools and approaches in consumption domains of energy use in the home, food and mobility; 3) discusses opportunities and limitations for devising more successful nudges in the three consumption domains; and 4) outlines critical issues concerning the legitimacy of nudging. The article shows that lately applications of behavioural sciences and behavioural economics, such as nudge, have been helping policy makers in different countries and sectors to more systematically integrate behavioural insights into policy design and implementation. However, the size of the effects of policy interventions and the actual outcomes of interventions in different contexts are very diverse. Results from one experiment cannot be indiscriminately generalised to a different context or to a wider population. The problem is the complexity of human behaviour and the diversity of factors that influence it. Despite that, nudging is a useful strategy for inducing changes in context-specific behaviour. Nudge tools are seen as a complement to the traditional policy instruments rather than as a substitute for laws and regulations and economic tools. The article is based on the project funded by the Swedish EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) that resulted in a report “Nudging. Advancing Swedish policy making with academic insights and practical experiences of changing behaviour” (Mont et al., 2014), which served as an input to the Swedish EPA' recommendations to the Swedish Government on policy measures for sustainable consumption (Naturvårdsverket, 2014).},

The shift is larger for species restricted to mountain habitats and for grassy species, which are characterized by faster population turnover.

For both types of activities, we start by disaggregating the total power usage down to individual electrical appliances. Then, we build an indicative activity model to reason four domestic activities using the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. To validate our algorithms, we use real energy and environmental data collected in an actual UK household over a period of three months, benchmarked on a time-stamped log of activities.

about electricity consumption in households. This information can be considered as feedback about
electricity use, which implies that in can be useful in raising energy awareness and promoting
electricity conservation practices. For three decades, feedback methods have been studied a
considerable literature exists about effective feedback. However, applying the principles of successful
feedback to in the design of electricity feedback products is never straight forward, because the
feedback must coupled with some product or service that the user finds useful or entertaining.
In this paper the extreme-user design method is introduced as a way of discovering what
requirements users have for feedback systems. Through a case study of 20 electric power meter
users, I illustrate the potential of this method in providing ideas for design. Through a semi-structured
interview I examined how the power meters are used, user satisfaction with the meters, and
motivations underlying the loan. Three categories of users were discovered and labeled wisdom
seekers, detectives, and judges. They had different attitudes towards electric devices, being
interested in learning, revealing, or evaluating energy consumption facts. These differences in user
attitudes indicate that different users likely require dissimilar functionalities from the feedback
application. It was also discovered that loaning the meter changed the attribution of consumption from
devices to habits. Initially the participants were looking for a faulty device that could explain their
electricity bill. However, after the measurements, their attribution changed and they understood that
their own habits would need to change in order to reduce consumption.},

In order to monitoring the status of each load, a sensor is installed for each load traditionally. The status of the load is transmitted to the main controller such that the status of each load can be monitored. On the other hand, the NILM is able to detect the status of loads by analyzing the current signals that is picked-up by a current sensor installed at the main electrical panel. Traditional NILM methods used real power, reactive power, harmonic contents of power signatures and transient energy to determine the status of appliances. These methods are very complex and require a lot of computation. In this paper, a novel method that integrates artificial intelligent recognition technique and load current acquisition method for NILM is proposed. The proposed method uses timedomain information. This approach is different from traditional NILM methods. The proposed method is able to detect the energization and de-energization of loads by applying back-propagation neural networks (BP-ANNs). The overall correct rate for this method is above 98.75%. This result shows that the proposed method is able to determine the operation status of loads with proper robustness.},

If each appliance operates efficiently, the power energy can be used and conserved effectively. Further, the greenhouse gases can also gradually be reduced. This paper* proposes a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) system that employs a decision mechanism based on hierarchical support vector machines (HSVM) to identify the energizing and de-energizing statuses of each load. In the proposed system, the load energizing and de-energizing transient features are extracted from load current waveforms that are acquired at the power entering point. The HSVM performs load identification tasks based on the features. Although a support vector machine (SVM) identifier can solve nonlinear separable cases and optimize the decision hyper-plane, it is a two-class identifier. On the other hand, the NILM problem is a multi-class identification problem. Since any multi-class identification problem can be decomposed into a series of two-class identification sub-problems, the proposed system applies a group of binary SVMs that are arranged into a form of hierarchical tree to identify the operation status of each load. Each node within the tree represents a binary SVM identifier, and each identifier is assigned to solve a corresponding two-class sub-problem. Through this hierarchical decision process, the class of an undetermined datum can be identified. Finally, the results in different experiment environments show that the proposed system is able to identify the operation status of each load, and it also has appropriate robustness.},

We propose a functional sensing model called SDR (Sampling-Design-Reconstruction) to decouple a sensing process into two modules: sampling protocol and reconstruction algorithm. The core of this decoupling is a design space, which is a common data structure constructed using functions of the sensing target as prior knowledge, to seamlessly bridge the sampling protocol and reconstruction algorithm together.

In this paper, we discuss the challenges in general NILM system with methods implemented. We focus on models applied in key steps, which are “event detection” and “load recognition”. Approaches in residential and commercial buildings are evaluated, where these two typical applications have gained lot attentions recently. The challenges in commercial building are explored and studied, and potential solution and research direction are discussed. It shows that unsolved problems and modern intelligent devices require more sophisticated NILM system in the future.},

  abstract =  {Many approaches to design for energy use behavior change lump ‘energy demand’ together as
something homogeneous, addressable primarily through quantitative feedback, rather than basing
interventions on an understanding of why people use energy as they do. Our contention is that people
don’t set out to ‘use energy’: its use is a side effect of solving everyday problems, meeting needs for
comfort, light, cooking, cleaning, entertainment, and so on. Judicious integration of quantitative energy
use data with qualitative insights from ethnographic research can allow a much more nuanced design
approach.
As part of SusLabNWE, a collaborative European project, we have been carrying out research
with a diverse range of householders, investigating daily interactions with heating and lighting, meters
and appliances—alongside people’s understanding of energy and how their actions affect its use.
Insights, integrated with household monitoring data, are informing the co-design of prototype products
and services to help people reduce their energy use while meeting needs.},

Although energy behaviours are a major determinant of energy use in buildings, energy savings potential due to behaviour are usually neglected, albeit being referred to be as high as those from technological solutions. This paper presents a review of recent literature on energy behaviours in order to recognise recent trends, quantify energy behaviours potential savings, characterise energy behaviour modelling strategies and identify potential research gaps. Energy behaviour research is vast and has been essentially focused on the residential sector, striving to establish behaviour determinants and the best strategies and instruments to promote more efficient energy behaviours. Potential savings of energy behaviours are referred to reach 20%, but values differ up to 100% between experiences and additional studies to quantify behavioural savings are needed, in particular by using standard quantification techniques. Different modelling techniques have been used to model energy behaviours: qualitative approaches from the social sciences trying to interpret behaviour, here named energy behaviour frameworks; quantitative approaches from the engineering and economics that quantify energy consumption, here designated by energy models; and hybrid approaches that are considered the most relevant since they integrate multiple dimensions of energy behaviours, here referred as energy behaviour modelling. Energy behaviours have a crucial role in promoting energy efficiency, but energy behaviours characteristics and complexity create several research challenges that must be overcome so energy behaviours may be properly valorised and integrated in the energy policy context.},

In addition to direct energy sensing methods, e.g. electricity and gas, it is often desirable to monitor energy use and occupant activity through other sensors such as temperature and motion. However, practical constraints such as cost and deployment requirements can limit the choice, quantity and quality of sensors that can be distributed within each building, especially for large-scale deployments. In this paper, we present an approach to select a set of sensors for capturing energy events, using a measure of each candidate sensor's ability to predict energy events within a building. We use constrained optimisation -- specifically, a bounded knapsack problem (BKP) -- to choose the best sensors for the set given each sensor's predictive value and specified cost constraints. We present the results from a field study of 4 UK homes with temperature, light, motion, humidity, sound and CO2 sensors, showing how valuable yet expensive sensors are often not chosen in the optimal set.},

We demonstrate the expressiveness of the GraphLab framework by designing and implementing parallel versions of belief propagation, Gibbs sampling, Co-EM, Lasso and Compressed Sensing.

These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

So far, the Antarctic Vostok and EPICA Dome C ice cores have provided a composite record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over the past 650,000 years. Here we present results of the lowest 200 m of the Dome C ice core, extending the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by two complete glacial cycles to 800,000 yr before present. From previously published data and the present work, we find that atmospheric carbon dioxide is strongly correlated with Antarctic temperature throughout eight glacial cycles but with significantly lower concentrations between 650,000 and 750,000 yr before present. Carbon dioxide levels are below 180 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.) for a period of 3,000 yr during Marine Isotope Stage 16, possibly reflecting more pronounced oceanic carbon storage. We report the lowest carbon dioxide concentration measured in an ice core, which extends the pre-industrial range of carbon dioxide concentrations during the late Quaternary by about 10 p.p.m.v. to 172–300 p.p.m.v.},

In this work, we propose an autonomous energy scheduling scheme for household appliances in real-time to achieve minimum consumption cost and reduction in peak load. We assume that every user is equipped with smart meter which has an Energy Consumption Controlling (ECC) unit. Every ECC unit is connected with its neighbours through local area network to share power consumption information. ECC units run a distributed algorithm to minimize the peak load by transferring the shiftable loads from peak hours to off-peak hours. This ultimately minimizes the total energy consumption cost.

Governments and power utilities must improve and expand policies that promote a socio-economic balance allowing everyone to participate in energy conservation regardless of their economic situation in a sustained way. We critically look at what economics and government polices exist and need to exist. We also demonstrate the computational means to achieve this - nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) - and discuss how manufacturing and standards organizations need to work together to provide the essential information that describes how appliances consume energy. This paper proposes a Consumer Bill of Rights for Energy Conservation.},

This analysis task is known as load disaggregation or non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). The datasets used for NILM research generally contain real power readings, with the data often being too coarse for more sophisticated analysis algorithms, and often covering too short a time period. We present the Almanac of Minutely Power dataset (AMPds) for load disaggregation research; it contains one year of data that includes 11 measurements at one minute intervals for 21 sub-meters.

Finally, we use AMPds to present findings from our own load disaggregation algorithm to show that current, rather than real power, is a more effective measure for NILM.},

  abstract =    {Understanding how the electrical appliances and devices in a house consume power is an important factor that can allow occupants to make intelligent and informed decisions about conserving energy. This is often not an easy task. These electrical loads can turn ON and OFF either by the actions of occupants, or by automatic sensing and actuation (e.g. thermostat). Even if we could keep track of when loads turned ON and OFF, it is difficult to understand how much a load consumes at any given operational state because of the lack of proper measurement reporting within equipment manuals. Occupants could buy sensors that would help, but this comes at a high financial cost. Power utility companies around the world are now replacing old electro-mechanical meters with digital meters (smart meters) that have enhanced communication capabilities. These smart meters are essentially a free sensor that offer an opportunity to use computation to infer what loads are currently running in a house and to estimate how much each load is consuming, a process often referred to as load disaggregation. This thesis presents a new load disaggregation algorithm (i.e. a disaggregator). This new disaggregator uses a super-state hidden Markov model and a new Viterbi algorithm variant which preserves dependencies between loads and can disaggregate multi-state loads, all while performing computationally efficient exact inference. Our sparse Viterbi algorithm can efficiently compute sparse matrices with a large number of super-states. Our disaggregator is the first of its kind to run in real-time on an inexpensive embedded processor using low sampling rates (e.g. per minute). Other contributions of the research include an analysis of electrical measurements, the release of a publicly available dataset, and a method for comprehensive accuracy testing and reporting.},

To meet this demand and enable the integration of renewable resources, electrical distribution networks are beginning to adopt smart-grid technologies by providing bidirectional communication between the distribution grid and the electric meter. The question of how appliances within the home will interface with the smart-grid is still an open question. We propose to use wireless sensor networks as a platform to enable detailed household monitoring, demand response, load scheduling, occupancy-based control, intelligent lighting, and other general-purpose control strategies. In this vision, the smart-grid interface is a single input to the building control system which consists of a wide variety of other sensors and supports many applications that greatly extend the capabilities of the smart-grid. To explore this concept we have: developed efficient and accurate energy disaggregation algorithms, developed reliable multicast and broadcast network protocols, evaluated 10 strategies for energy savings, designed a WSN-based building monitoring and control platform, and evaluated this approach in both offices and a residential home.},

The two proposed approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique. Here, we describe two approaches for circuit-level NILM that enable detailed, practical household energy monitoring: a heuristic-based approach and a Bayesian approach. Both address the limitations of previous NILM algorithms by considering steady-state power use in addition to step changes in steady-state power use and by using circuit-level energy measurements. Using the historical steady-state energy use pattern for each device lets us more precisely classify each edge and eliminate some cases of indistinguishable step changes. By measuring energy use at the circuit level, we can overcome the inability of whole-house NILM to monitor small or variable-power devices. This is because there are fewer devices on each circuit and high-powered devices (such as a stove, hot-water heater, air conditioner, and clothes dryer) each receive dedicated circuits and won't overshadow lower-powered devices (such as LVs, radios, and cell phone chargers).},

Measuring energy usage is not difficult, however we must decide what to measure. Whole-home energy measurement is cheap and easy to setup because only one sensor is placed where the home connects to the power grid. The collected data can provide useful information for large appliances. However, the only way to monitor the energy usage of smaller devices is to install an energy meter on every device of interest. This creates a very detailed picture of household energy consumption, but requires a lot of additional hardware---one meter per device in the home. This paper explores an alternative, more practical, approach to monitor household energy usage including small devices. Our approach uses circuit-level power measurements and a new method to separate aggregate data into device-level estimates. Our initial evaluation resulted in an average error less than 5:35% for three devices with good response to changing device state. We therefore believe that this approach, coupled with a device-level control system, would create an ideal architecture for the next generation of household energy management systems.},

We used a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) plug load management system to capture relevant data for two different types of multi-function devices (MFDs) in the facility, one of which was tested for use with different power settings. This enabled a quantitative analysis to assess impacts on energy consumption. It was found that a projected 65% reduction in annual energy consumption would result by using a newer, Energy Star compliant model of MFD, and an additional projected 39% reduction in annual energy consumption would result by subsequently changing the time-to-sleep for that MFD. It was also found that it may be beneficial to apply automated analysis with anomaly detection algorithms to detect problems with MFD performance, such as a failure to go to sleep mode or variations in sleep power draw. Furthermore, we observed that energy savings realized by using plug load management devices to de-energize (unplug) MFDs during non-business hours depends on the sleep power draw and time-to-sleep setting. For the MFDs in this study with settings established per the maintenance contract (which were different than factory default values), turning the device off at night and then on in the morning used more energy than leaving it on in sleep mode due to the start-up behavior and excessive time-to-sleep setting of four hours. From this and other assessments, we offer these recommendations to building occupants: reduce MFD time-to-sleep, encourage employees to use the power save button, and apply automated analysis to detect problems with device performance.},

  abstract =     {In order to enhance electricity conservation in households, detecting which electric appliances consume high electricity is effective. However, collecting every data of electric appliances needs many devices and it would be high costs. Therefore, data disaggregation from total data to each appliance leads to the reduction of cost and electricity. This paper presents how to disaggregate the consumption of electric appliances from total electricity consumption. In order to disaggregate electricity consumption of electric appliances from total energy consumption, sparse coding has been implemented. However, changes in the use of electric appliances are difficult to express in this method. Therefore, we propose a novel sparse coding method, named, “0-1 sparse coding” to disaggregate which electric appliances were used in the total consumption of electricity. In order to collected sample data for analyzing the methods, we installed smart metering systems in two households. The system collects the data of total electricity consumption and data in the main electric appliances in every 5-minutes. We evaluate two methods, 1) our proposed method, and 2) discriminative sparse coding method. From the results, our proposed method increased the accuracy about 44.8% than the previous method.},

To train the network, a measurement of the power sig-nal of the target appliance in addition to the total power signalduring the same time period is required. The method is super-vised, but less restrictive in practice since submetering of animportant appliance or a subcircuit for a short time is feasi-ble. The main advantages of this approach are: a) It is alsoapplicable to variable load and not restricted to on-offandmulti-state appliances. b) It does not require hand-engineeredevent detection and feature extraction. c) By using multiplenetworks, it is possible to disaggregate multiple appliances orsubcircuits at the same time. d) It also works with a low costpower meter as shown in the experiments with the ReferenceEnergy Disaggregation (REDD) dataset (1/3Hz sampling fre-quency, only real power).},

Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences. The hippocampal system permits rapid learning of new items without disrupting this structure, and reinstatement of new memories interleaves them with others to integrate them into structured neocortical memory systems.},

However, the provenance and age of the fossils have been much debated5, 6. Here we confirm that the Omo I and Omo II hominid fossils are from similar stratigraphic levels in Member I of the Kibish Formation, despite the view that Omo I is more modern in appearance than Omo II1, 2, 3. 40Ar/39Ar ages on feldspar crystals from pumice clasts within a tuff in Member I below the hominid levels place an older limit of 198 plusminus 14 kyr (weighted mean age 196 plusminus 2 kyr) on the hominids. A younger age limit of 104 plusminus 7 kyr is provided by feldspars from pumice clasts in a Member III tuff. Geological evidence indicates rapid deposition of each member of the Kibish Formation. Isotopic ages on the Kibish Formation correspond to ages of Mediterranean sapropels, which reflect increased flow of the Nile River, and necessarily increased flow of the Omo River. Thus the 40Ar/39Ar age measurements, together with the sapropel correlations, indicate that the hominid fossils have an age close to the older limit. Our preferred estimate of the age of the Kibish hominids is 195 plusminus 5 kyr, making them the earliest well-dated anatomically modern humans yet described.},

These profiles can be mined by Non Intrusive Load Monitors (NILMs) to expose much of the human activity within the served site. This paper introduces a new class of algorithms and systems, called Non Intrusive Load Leveling (NILL) to combat potential invasions of privacy. NILL uses an in-residence battery to mask variance in load on the grid, thus eliminating exposure of the appliance-driven information used to compromise consumer privacy. We use real residential energy use profiles to drive four simulated deployments of NILL. The simulations show that NILL exposes only 1.1 to 5.9 useful energy events per day hidden amongst hundreds or thousands of similar battery-suppressed events. Thus, the energy profiles exhibited by NILL are largely useless for current NILM algorithms. Surprisingly, such privacy gains can be achieved using battery systems whose storage capacity is far lower than the residence's aggregate load average. We conclude by discussing how the costs of NILL can be offset by energy savings under tiered energy schedules.},

It marked a historical turn in artificial intelligence, and it is required reading for anyone who wants to understand the connectionist counterrevolution that is going on today.

Artificial-intelligence research, which for a time concentrated on the programming of ton Neumann computers, is swinging back to the idea that intelligence might emerge from the activity of networks of neuronlike entities. Minsky and Papert's book was the first example of a mathematical analysis carried far enough to show the exact limitations of a class of computing machines that could seriously be considered as models of the brain. Now the new developments in mathematical tools, the recent interest of physicists in the theory of disordered matter, the new insights into and psychological models of how the brain works, and the evolution of fast computers that can simulate networks of automata have given Perceptrons new importance.

Witnessing the swing of the intellectual pendulum, Minsky and Papert have added a new chapter in which they discuss the current state of parallel computers, review developments since the appearance of the 1972 edition, and identify new research directions related to connectionism. They note a central theoretical challenge facing connectionism: the challenge to reach a deeper understanding of how "objects" or "agents" with individuality can emerge in a network. Progress in this area would link connectionism with what the authors have called "society theories of mind."

  abstract =     {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

  abstract =     {Change points detection in time series is an important area of research in statistics, has a long history and has many applications. However, very often change point analysis is only focused on the changes in the mean value of some quantity in a process. In this work we consider time series with discrete point changes which may contain a finite number of changes of probability density functions (pdf). We focus on the case where the data in all segments are modeled by Gaussian probability density functions with different means, variances and correlation lengths. We put a prior law on the change point occurances (Poisson process) as well as on these different parameters (conjugate priors) and give the expression of the posterior probability distributions of these change points. The computations are done by using an appropriate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique.

The problem as we stated can also be considered as an unsupervised classification and/or segmentation of the time serie. This analogy gives us the possibility to propose alternative modeling and computation of change points.},

However, the widespread deployment of smart meters has serious privacy implications since they inadvertently leak detailed information about household activities. In this paper, we show that even without a priori knowledge of household activities or prior training, it is possible to extract complex usage patterns from smart meter data using off-the-shelf statistical methods. Our analysis uses two months of data from three homes, which we instrumented to log aggregate household power consumption every second. With the data from our small-scale deployment, we demonstrate the potential for power consumption patterns to reveal a range of information, such as how many people are in the home, sleeping routines, eating routines, etc. We then sketch out the design of a privacy-enhancing smart meter architecture that allows an electric utility to achieve its net metering goals without compromising the privacy of its customers.},

The training procedure for individual devices is discussed. Accuracies of seven different device models are assessed using k-fold cross validation. In this assessment, the correlations between sequences of known state transitions and calculated Viterbi sequences representing predicted transitions are determined.

The legally binding requirements of the climate change act [Department of Energy and Climate Change. (2008). The climate change act.

In this study the range of energy consumption patterns observed across workstations in two typical UK, air-conditioned office spaces covering 90 desks and the potential effect of using feedback to encourage energy reduction through behaviour change are explored. The project monitored energy consumption over a four-month baseline period. Taking into account technical, behavioural and environmental influences this baseline established that a significant variation in consumption patterns exists between workstations providing the same function, in comparable locations and over the same period of time. Following the establishment of the baseline data further monitoring took place to assess the effect of behaviour change interventions through the provision of comparative feedback. The core driver behind the variation in consumption identified was found to be occupant behaviour over technical and environmental considerations. The study establishes that it is possible to reduce energy use, carbon emissions and cost associated with desk-level electricity consumption by up to 20\% through behaviour change in typical UK office spaces. Further savings are possible through energy management and procurement policy, but behaviour change offers significant initial reductions for limited investment.},

Firstly, we study how kettles are used across 14 UK households for a two-year period, which allows analysis of seasonal patterns as well as changes due to the holiday season. We also examine usage patterns based on the type of occupant and how their daily routines affect usage. Secondly, a
case study is described where a standard kettle has been replaced with an ‘eco’ kettle during the monitoring period, which allows to analyse if energy consumption has been reduced due to using a more energy efficient kettle. We look at the usage patterns and investigate potential change in behaviour that has occurred since the switch. Our main findings based on monitoring diverse UK homes with a range of kettles, is that the total consumption is less dependent on the type of kettle used, and more dependent on the established household usage patterns and habits. We also show, through our case study, that usage of kettles can be improved by optimising usage patterns to best
utilise the type of kettle.},

  abstract =     {The introduction of electricity monitors (in-home displays; IHDs), which show accurate and up-to-the-minute energy usage, is expected to lead to reduction in consumption. Studies of feedback on domestic electricity use have generally supported this view. However, such studies also demonstrate wide variation between households. Examining the heterogeneity of responses is essential for understanding the actual and potential effectiveness of IHDs and in order to target interventions effectively. To explore differences between households' responses to IHDs, we conducted a qualitative study with 21 households who had an IHD for more than six months. Of the 21, only four households continued to refer to the IHD and the findings suggest that attempts to reduce energy consumption were situated in wider social and physical contexts. Further, the participants demonstrated energy saving behaviour before and outside of IHD usage. The patterns of energy behaviours and attempts at electricity conservation could best be understood by categorising the households into three types: the Monitor Enthusiasts (20%), the Aspiring Energy Savers (60%) and the Energy Non-Engaged (20%). The factors of importance in energy behaviour differed between the categories. Financial savings contributed to efforts to reduce energy use but only up to boundaries which varied considerably between households. Social practices and social relationships appeared to constrain what actions households were prepared to undertake, illuminating aspects of inter-household variation. Within the household, all energy users were not equal and we found that women were particularly influential on energy use through their primary responsibility for domestic labour on behalf of the household. The implications of the findings for environmental campaigning are discussed.},

A detailed overview is given of different existing applications and which stages of change these affect. However, as none of these existing smart meters features comprehensive and combined informational strategies that systematically cater to consumers in all stages of behavioural change, it is concluded that further efforts to optimise and evaluate smart meters should be undertaken.

Building effective DR mechanisms and user awareness on power consumption can significantly benefit from fine-grained monitoring of user consumption at the appliance level. However, installing and maintaining such a monitoring infrastructure in residential settings can be quite expensive. In this paper, we study the problem of fine-grained appliance power-consumption monitoring based on one house-level meter and few plug-level meters. We explore the trade-off between monitoring accuracy and cost, and exhaustively find the minimum subset of plug-level meters that maximize accuracy. As exhaustive search is time- and resource-consuming, we define a heuristic approach that finds the optimal set of plug-level meters without utilizing any other sets of plug-level meters. Based on experiments with real data, we found that few plug-level meters - when appropriately placed - can very accurately disaggregate the total real power consumption of a residential setting and verified the effectiveness of our heuristic approach.},

Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation aims to estimate appliance level energy consumption from the aggregate consumption data of households. NILM algorithms, proposed hitherto, are either centralized or do require high performance systems to derive appliance level data, owing to the computational complexity associated. This approach raises several issues related to scalability and privacy of consumer's data. In this paper, we present the Location-aware Energy Disaggregation Framework (LocED) that utilizes occupancy of users to derive accurate appliance level usage information. LocED framework limits the appliances considered for disaggregation based on the current location of occupants. Thus, LocED can provide real-time feedback on appliance level energy consumption and run on an embedded system locally at the household. We propose several accuracy metrics to study the performance of LocED. To test the robustness of LocED, we empirically evaluated it across multiple publicly available datasets. LocED has significantly high energy disaggregation accuracy while exponentially reducing the computational complexity. We also release our comprehensive dataset DRED (Dutch Residential Energy Dataset) for public use, which measures electricity, occupancy and ambient parameters of the household.},

A Java-based implementation of the method in a new model of the UK housing stock, DECarb, is examined using a back-cast scenario from 1970 to 1996. The results show an average difference of −5.4% between predicted and actual energy demand. Comparison with predicted carbon emissions from the BRE's BREHOMES model shows a difference of around −0.9% for the same period. These results suggest that DECarb is likely to be an effective tool in examining future scenarios since the same objects and processes used in back-casting in the model are also used in forecasting.

This paper reviews some existing models and highlights limitations of their common underlying methodologies. We argue that a radically different, integrated, approach is required to tackle these challenges and ensure that the modelling remain robust and able to meet future demands. We suggest that Agent Based Modelling (ABM) is a suitable candidate modelling paradigm to achieve an integrated modelling framework. We also present DECarb-ABM (an ABM based implementation of an existing model, DECarb) with many of the desired properties of such an integrated framework. The new model is validated against both the existing model and historical data.},

There are major risks the Department of Energy and Climate Change must address to achieve value for money from its £11.3 billion national programme to install ‘smart’ electricity and gas meters in all homes and smaller non-domestic premises in Great Britain from 2014 to 2019, according to a report by the National Audit Office.

Smart meters provide consumers with detailed information on their energy use and can enable energy suppliers to provide a wider range of off-peak tariffs as well as allowing suppliers to collect meter readings remotely. The Department expects them to be an important step towards ‘smart grids’, which may help to manage demand across the electricity system.

The NAO’s early assessment of the programme concludes that the Department has made progress in developing its approach in the early phase, which cost £11.2 million. However, in this phase, it did not demonstrate full value for money, because its early planning and budgeting were insufficient to support clear monitoring and accountability. The Department is strengthening programme management.

The cost of installing smart meters in every home and smaller non-domestic premise and the associated communications technology will be borne by energy suppliers. The Department expects suppliers to pass the costs and efficiency savings on to their customers. The estimate by the Department of the total cost of the programme – currently £11.3 billion – includes some provision for cost escalation. But uncertainties remain, and the Department still has to develop a specification for the central data and communications system.

The Department estimates the economic benefits at £18.6 billion between 2011 and 2030 (achieving a discounted net benefit of £7.3 billion). However, today’s report identifies uncertainty, based on the evidence available so far, about the extent to which smart meters will result in changed energy use by consumers over a sustained period. The Department has still to develop its benefits realisation plans and consumer engagement strategy.

Other risks that the NAO has highlighted are that there is very little contingency time to address the risk that design approvals, procurement and testing take longer than planned; that the system will have to be flexible enough to minimize the risk of future obsolescence; and that the Department has more work to do before roll-out starts on the security of the system.},

  abstract =     {This paper examines the participation of Dutch households in a smart and sustainable energy transition. Particular attention is paid to new forms of cooperation that are arising between households (horizontal opening-up) and between households and service providers (vertical opening-up). Data are drawn from an online survey and a focus group discussion among householders who have some experience with sustainable energy practices. To guide the analysis we discern three energy management practices that come along with the advent of smart energy systems (energy monitoring, renewable energy production and time-shifting), and three social arrangements entailing different ways of organising these practices (private, horizontal and vertical arrangements). While survey respondents, in general, prove to be supportive of both vertically and horizontally arranged energy management practices, we also find that they run into specific privacy and autonomy problems that shape or even impede their participation. In addition, the focus group shows that shared understandings of conventional energy systems and shared experiences with alternative schemes create strong parallels between anticipated arrangements of new practices. It is concluded that decentralised systems are particularly promising for promoting householder participation, as they enable the bundling of energy management practices and the renegotiation of horizontal–vertical relationships.

Highlights
• We examine householder participation in new energy management practices.
• Participation involves a vertical and horizontal opening up of the household.
• Autonomy and privacy concerns are shown to impede participation.
• Participation can be fostered through decentralised cooperation.},

Research areas requiring additional focus relate to study participation levels, the persistence of feedback effects, the relative value of different types of feedback, dynamic pricing interactions, and distinguishing the effects of feedback among different demographic groups. Current utility research activity will address many of these areas, but it is difficult for any one utility to address all of them.

We use the hundreds of images available in a video stream to improve the quality of a simple photometric data term, and minimise a global spatially regularised energy functional in a novel non-convex optimisation framework. Interleaved, we track the camera's 6DOF motion precisely by frame-rate whole image alignment against the entire dense model. Our algorithms are highly parallelisable throughout and DTAM achieves real-time performance using current commodity GPU hardware. We demonstrate that a dense model permits superior tracking performance under rapid motion compared to a state of the art method using features; and also show the additional usefulness of the dense model for real-time scene interaction in a physics-enhanced augmented reality application.},

TOU tariffs are presented as financial opportunities but outcomes depend on flexibility in household practices. Households with children have higher peak electricity consumption and this paper investigates how and why practices performed during the weekday peak ‘hang together’. We conducted forty-four interviews and home tours followed by a survey (547 responses) of households with children in Australia. Our analysis finds that the family peak is tightly coordinated and routinised. Interlinked bundles of practices were meaningful beyond their commonly assumed functions. For example, bathing of children (re-) connected siblings and parents, occupied children while dinner was prepared or cleaned up, and calmed children in preparation for sleeping. The analysis also shows how flexibility during the peak period is constrained by the relation to other periods of the weekday, along with its synchronisation with school, work and childcare arrangements. From our analysis of we conclude that TOU tariffs are unlikely to effectively reduce peak period electricity consumption in households with children and may have inequitable financial and/or social impacts for these households. Alternative approaches that better engage with the dynamics of social practice in family households are suggested.},

  abstract =     {The goal of analyzing a time series database is to find whether and how frequent a periodic pattern is repeated within the series. Periodic pattern mining is the problem that regards temporal regularity. However, most of the existing algorithms have a major limitation in mining interesting patterns of users interest, that is, they can mine patterns of specific length with all the events sequentially one after another in exact positions within this pattern. Though there are certain scenarios where a pattern can be flexible, that is, it may be interesting and can be mined by neglecting any number of unimportant events in between important events with variable length of the pattern. Moreover, existing algorithms can detect only specific type of periodicity in various time series databases and require the interaction from user to determine periodicity. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm for the periodic pattern mining in time series databases which does not rely on the user for the period value or period type of the pattern and can detect all types of periodic patterns at the same time, indeed these flexibilities are missing in existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm facilitates the user to generate different kinds of patterns by skipping intermediate events in a time series database and find out the periodicity of the patterns within the database. It is an improvement over the generating pattern using suffix tree, because suffix tree based algorithms have weakness in this particular area of pattern generation. Comparing with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves generating different kinds of interesting patterns and detects whether the generated pattern is periodic or not. We have tested the performance of our algorithm on both synthetic and real life data from different domains and found a large number of interesting event sequences which were missing in existing algorithms and the proposed algorithm was efficient enough in generating and detecting periodicity of flexible patterns on both types of data.},

  abstract =    {Reducing energy use in buildings, and improving building operation, are hindered by a lack of detailed data about device energy use and related data.  Traditionally, collecting such data has been expensive and usually required new hardware.  However, advances in information technology offer opportunities to address this problem that can substantially remove this barrier for an increasing portion of building energy use.

In this research, we define “Energy Reporting” as the ability of a device to report information about its own energy use to another device on a local network.  People who own or operate buildings can usually rely only on whole-building utility billing data to understand energy use.  Utility bills can be supplemented with information from the building inventory (e.g., maintenance schedule), manufacturer's device characteristics (e.g., rated power), and pre-defined operating schedules.  However, these other sources are often unreliable, the information can be costly to obtain, and the data rarely has adequate granularity in time, product characteristics, or usage context to generate an accurate picture of energy use.  Secondary sources of energy consumption data also fail to provide information about equipment that is not identified, that operates differently from the way that is intended, is malfunctioning, or is otherwise performing in a way that merits further investigation.  Energy Reporting can, over time, overcome all of these problems, and at no additional cost in devices that already have communications ability.
 
The public sector could advance Energy Reporting technology in several ways: 

* aiding the development of technology standards, 
* working to move the technology into products, 
* creating reference energy management systems, and 
* expanding the adoption and use of the technology.  

Federal, state, and local policymakers may be able to use data from Energy Reporting to develop more effective, widely applicable, and robust policies; in addition, the data availability may reduce the costs for policy development.

This report presents an overview of Energy Reporting technologies and deployments, the types of data involved, how Energy Reporting is used, and the content of technology standards.  It also outlines technology needs for future Energy Reporting protocols and systems, which public policy developers could use to guide the development of technology standards.},

This will make it possible for building owners to get information about energy use and other attributes automatically, at no additional cost.  The technology to enable this, “Energy Reporting” is the ability of an individual device to report on its own power use, energy use, and power state to the network [Nordman, 2013a].  A number of protocols and data models exist or are being developed for this purpose, but a key problem is that none of them include a facility for a device to simply indicate what it “is."  Examples of a device type could be refrigerator, light, computer, TV, or dishwasher.  This paper proposes such a list of device types — perhaps the first — a Simple Universal Device Classification System, which we abbreviate to UDC.},

  abstract =    {Wide and simple interoperability of building components and devices is necessary to provide high functionality for occupants, and energy efficiency, in a cost-effective way.  This minimizes hardware, software, and human time needed to integrate disparate and dynamic devices in buildings as well as human occupancy.  The development of a suitable single data model for building interoperability is an important research area; past work has primarily developed data models for particular communications protocols or usage contexts.  This paper presents a review of existing taxonomies and data models used in communication between energy-using devices in buildings, and a set of recommended best practices.  Research such as this is needed to help move technology standards and devices towards more harmonized information exchange to help accomplish interoperability.   Much further work is still required to assess more technology standards, more topic areas, and present the results to the many relevant stakeholders. 

The core focus of this report is how numerical information and other data from sensors and devices could be described in a standard way.  Examples of such underlying data standards include a list of sensor values and corresponding time stamps.  Metadata can identify that the values correspond to a sensor, that the sensor is a power meter, the units are in kW, that it is located in a particular electrical panel, and that it measures lighting loads for a certain floor of a building.  We conducted a survey of existing work on data models and schemas in standards bodies, and from community-driven open source development.  Overall we reviewed the current status of over twenty organizations on metadata for energy related applications.
There are broad commonalities in the metadata information content across sources, but each organization utilizes somewhat different terminology and data structures to represent and communicate this information.  These variations create interoperability challenges as each group forges a path that may be internally consistent to suit their needs, but inconsistent with other groups.  The work presented here provides some structure and concepts to use in developing best practices, guidelines, and ultimately a common data model.},

are very useful for performance monitoring and fault detection.
Goals:
• Reduce the energy consumption and associated environmental degradation of
commercial buildings in California, the U.S. and throughout the world;
• Reduce energy costs.
How to meet these goals?
• Deployment of appropriate methods for monitoring building performance and
automatically detecting and diagnosing faults in energy-consuming equipment or in
building components that directly affect energy usage.
Measurements are valuable but often expensive:
• Can't control what cannot be measured;
• Component-specific data brings into sharp focus variations in whole-building energy
consumption patterns that may hint at operating problems and energy waste;
• Building owner and operators are naturally reluctant to invest in more sensors.
One way to move forward is to make as much use as possible from electricityconsumption
data:
• Electricity-consumption data can be directly related to operating costs through
electricity rates or bilateral purchase contracts;
• Detailed measurements can help detect and diagnose excessive whole-building energy
usage and component-level faults.
How to keep costs down?
Researchers at MIT over the last 15 years have taken significant strides toward
developing a very powerful electricity monitoring approach that can pull component-level
information out of whole-building electrical service, the electricity supplied to a major
building subsystem (HVAC), or other electrical systems (transportation, industry). The
product based on this approach is known as a Non-Intrusive Load Monitor or, more
simply, NILM. More information about the NILM is found in [1-4].
We consider several field applications to illustrate the utility of the NILM},

The paper reviews evaluation methods used internationally for both building thermal efficiency and building energy labelling and presents results from two discrete studies in South Australia on monitoring actual household energy consumption. In order to investigate the occupancy effect on household energy, monitored energy data collected from two different housing developments in South Australia were examined. The energy ratings for these homes are compliant with the national agreed protocols for thermal performance modelling of dwellings, where one set of homes is a group occupied by higher socio-economic groups and the other is low income public housing in a colder climate region with much poorer home energy ratings. The wide variation of actual household energy for the homes that have relatively similar thermal envelopes indicates a lack of meaningful use for actual household energy in disclosure of house energy performance. Therefore, it is argued that thermal modelling software used to rate homes appears a more useful application of a system of disclosure of energy performance than the use of energy bills.},

One of the crucial functions of a brain is to make predictions of what will happen next, or in the near future. This ability helps us to anticipate upcoming events and plan our reactions to them in advance. To make these predictions, past information needs to be stored, transformed or used otherwise. How exactly the brain achieves this information processing is far from clear and under heavy investigation. To guide this extraordinary research effort, neuroscientists increasingly look for theoretical frameworks that could help explain the data recorded from the brain, and to make the enormous task more manageable. This is evident, for instance, through the funding of the billion-dollar ”Human Brain Project”, of the European Union, amongst others. Mathematical techniques from graph and information theory, control theory, dynamical and complex systems (Sporns 2011), statistical mechanics (Rolls and Deco 2010), as well as machine learning and computer vision (Seung 2012; Hawkins and Blakeslee 2004), have provided new insights into brain structure and possible function, and continue to generate new hypotheses for future research.},

As part of an interdisciplinary research project, this study interviewed households prior to the installation of smart home technologies (SHTs) in order to identify critical issues at the pre-installation phase. Semi-structured interviews took place in 16 houses before the installation of SHTs, when a range of smart sensors and controls were presented to households for the first time. At this stage, they started to make key decisions about which devices to use, where to install, and how to position them. Participants mentioned diverse issues surrounding the introduction of SHTs. To guide the qualitative analysis, an organizing framework for research on smart homes and their users was used. This paper indicates that, even though participants appreciate the functional aspects of SHTs and the possibilities of a better living, their concerns related to technology (hardware & software), design (acceptability & usability) and spaces (home as complex places) are numerous. These results complement the existing literature (which focuses more on the use phase) with the perceived enablers and barriers prior to the installation of SHTs.

In this study, RBF networks, K-nearest neighbor classifiers (KNNs) (e.g. [42]), SVMs and ν-Arc (cf. Section 6.2) were compared. The data set available for this task is rather small (36 examples), since the collection and labeling of data is manual and therefore expensive. As a result of this, one has to be very careful with finding good model parameters. All model parameters were found using the computationally expensive but generally reliable leave-one-out method. The results reported in [139] demonstrate that the ν-Arc algorithm with RBF networks as base learner performs better on average than all other algorithms studied, followed closely by the SVM classifier with a RBF kernel. These results suggest that the goal of a control system to balance load peaks might be a feasible prospect in the not too distant future."},

  abstract =  {The target audience for this guide is utilities planning to deploy Demand Response (DR)
programs that utilize OpenADR 2.0 for communicating DR event related messages between
the utility and downstream entities, and the manufacturers of equipment that facilitate that
communication exchange. It is assumed that the reader has a basic conceptual understanding
of both demand response and OpenADR 2.0 (referred to simply as OpenADR from this point
forward).
The OpenADR profile specifications clearly define the expected behaviour when exchanging
DR event related information, however there is enough optionality in OpenADR that the
deployment of servers (VTNs) at the utility and clients (VENs) at downstream sites is not a
plug-n-play experience. OpenADR characteristics such as event signals, report formats, and
targeting must be specified on a DR program-by-program basis.
There is no such thing as a standardized DR program. Each DR program design tends to be
unique, fitting the structural and regulatory requirements of the geographic region it is
deployed in. For each DR program there are numerous possible deployment scenarios
involving a variety of actors.
The variability in DR program designs, deployment scenarios, and OpenADR characteristics
are an inhibitor to expanded deployment of DR and the use of OpenADR. This variability is for
the most part a reflection of the fragmented and complex nature of the smart grid.
Utilities need examples of typical DR programs so that they can be used as models for their
own DR program implementations. Equipment manufacturers need to understand typical DR
Program usage models so they can validate interoperability as part of the development
process rather than on a DR program deployment specific basis. The intent of this guide is to
accomplish both these goals as follows:

• Define a small set of standard DR Program templates modelled after the common
characteristics of the most popular DR programs implemented to date
• Define a small set of deployment scenarios modelled after real world deployments,
with actors and roles clearly identified
• Define best practices recommendations for OpenADR characteristics specific for each
of the DR Program templates
• Provide a decision tree that utilities can use to identify the useful DR program
templates and deployment scenarios based upon their business needs

The emphasis in this guide will be on keeping things simple by providing a small set of clear
recommendations that will address the majority of the details required to deploy a typical DR
program, and to enable interoperability testing of equipment deployed in programs using the
recommendations in this guide.},

Experimental evidence suggests that if these trends continue, key marine organisms—such as corals and some plankton—will have difficulty maintaining their external calcium carbonate skeletons. Here we use 13 models of the ocean–carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a 'business-as-usual' scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean. When live pteropods were exposed to our predicted level of undersaturation during a two-day shipboard experiment, their aragonite shells showed notable dissolution. Our findings indicate that conditions detrimental to high-latitude ecosystems could develop within decades, not centuries as suggested previously.},

microgeneration, the Renewable Heat Incentive, Warm Front, smart meters and in-home
displays. Within the plan there is an increasing emphasis not just on installing energy savings
measures and low carbon energy sources but also on developing a greater response from
households and other energy users to reduce demand for energy overall and at times of
higher prices. Such demand response could help to meet carbon, security of supply and
economic objectives.
The Government has decided that all homes should have gas and electricity smart meters by
2020. In December 2009 it also decided on its preferred delivery model – central
communications with competitive meter roll-out. The GB Meter Impact Assessment2
identifies energy savings as the largest economic value in the overall analysis of benefits from
smart meters. This is assumed to be largely via improved awareness and feedback, but some
of the savings are also assumed to come from new time of use tariffs.
In time, the roll-out of smart meters will allow universal and accurate recording of how
much gas or electricity is used by individuals – and when. This will facilitate differential
charging – either by time of use and / or by volume. New forms of retail tariff – smart tariffs
– might therefore be offered to customers to encourage a demand response.
This report looks ahead to the time when household smart meters will be widespread and
thus new tariffs and price incentives might be offered more widely. * It examines some of
the main issues of principle and practicality likely to arise in introducing new smart-tariffs for
households, from both a consumer and market-actor point of view, as well as likely
implications for public policy. The report deals with tariffs designed to shift or reduce
demand only. It does not cover social tariffs or tariffs for microgeneration. The report is in
two parts :
• Part I considers the implications for consumers of new retail tariffs facilitated by
smart meters.
• Part II considers wider public policy, commercial incentives and regulatory issues,
likely to arise from future development of GB household demand response. It
includes some high level modeling work carried out by The Brattle Group for this
study.},

  abstract =    {The Household Electricity Survey (HES) was the most
detailed monitoring of electricity use ever carried
out in the UK. Preliminary findings were published in
2012, and provided unparalleled insights about
energy use in the home. This is a summary of more
thorough analysis of the survey data, structured
around 30 questions drawn up by DECC and DEFRA.
The work was carried out in 2013 and 2014, and
more detailed reports are available here1
.
The opportunity to glean more from this data could
hardly be more timely. We are at a critical juncture
in planning electricity generation, where the UK
must invest £110bn in energy infrastructure2
– partly
to replace the power stations built in the 1960s and
70s, now reaching the end of their useful lives. We
must meet the Government’s target of an 80%
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and
at the same time balance the necessities of
maintaining the country’s fuel security and allocating
resources wisely for the long-term. We cannot make
informed decisions about electricity generation
without also understanding the potential for
efficiencies and savings from households (and other
sectors). This relies on robust data and analysis.
At the same time, the UK Government is committed
to the most complex smart metering and consumer
engagement project in the world – the vision of a
smart grid, where data becomes the prime 
commodity to manage consumption and demand.
The Green Deal is also changing the landscape for
cutting energy use in homes.
In this report we present our answers to four
questions about household electricity use: what it is
used for, when it is used, who uses it, and how this
might change over the next few decades.

Findings
Our findings span five themes, addressing different
aspects of electricity use in homes. First we look at
appliances: what appliances householders own,
what energy labels they have, how old they are, and
when they tend to replace them. Then we examine
how much electricity could be saved in different
ways and how much could be trimmed from the
peak load. Finally we look at the scope for improving
the modelling of electricity use in homes, and social
studies that were carried out under the project.
Appliances
We found enormous variation in the ages of
appliances the HES households owned, with one
fridge-freezer 41 years old. The average appliance
age across all households varied from 3.8 years for
kettles to 8.4 years for fridge-freezers. Only a tiny
proportion of households owned the most efficient
appliance currently available, and for cold
appliances, washing machines, tumble dryers and
dishwashers almost 100% could be replaced with
more efficient models. The most efficient models
available are at least 20% more efficient than the
most commonly owned ones.
Cold appliances and washing machines are also
getting bigger: fridges purchased by HES households
got two-fifths bigger, on average, from 1985 to 2011,
while freezers and fridge-freezers grew by one fifth.
On average, this increase in size is partially offsetting
the efficiency gains made by appliance
manufacturers},

Taking care to highly limit the costs of installation and management, our work proposes a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) approach, which consists of disaggregating the whole-house power consumption into the individual portions associated to each device. State of the art NILM algorithms need monitoring data sampled at high frequency, thus requiring high costs for data collection and management. In this paper, we propose an NILM approach that relaxes the requirements on monitoring data since it uses total active power measurements gathered at low frequency (about 1 Hz). The proposed approach is based on the use of Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMM) in conjunction with context information related to the user presence in the house and the hourly utilization of appliances. Through a set of tests, we investigated how the use of these additional context-awareness features could improve disaggregation results with respect to the basic FHMM algorithm. The tests have been performed by using Tracebase, an open dataset made of data gathered from real home environments.},

We describe a way to automatically generate a Markov model from a written score that models the score form, and an on-line algorithm to align a performance to a score. The resulting system can follow performances that take alternate paths through the score without losing its place. We compare the performance of our system to that of sequence-based score followers on a melodic corpus of 98 Jazz melodies. Results show that explicitly representing the branching structure of a score significantly improves score following when the branch a performer may take is unknown beforehand.},

  abstract =    {Energy monitoring and smart grid applications have rapidly developed into a multi-billion dollar market. The continued growth and utility of monitoring technologies is predicated upon the ability to economically extract actionable information from acquired data streams. One of the largest roadblocks to effective analytics arises from the disparities of scale inherent in all aspects of data collection and processing. Managing these multifaceted dynamic range issues is crucial to the success of load monitoring and smart grid technology.

This thesis presents NilmDB, a comprehensive framework for energy monitoring applications. The NilmDB management system is a network-enabled database that supports efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of vast, timestamped data sets. It allows a flexible and powerful separation between on-site, high-bandwidth processing operations and off-site, low-bandwidth control and visualization. Specific analysis can be performed as data is acquired, or retroactively as needed, using short filter scripts written in Python and transferred to the monitor.

The NilmDB framework is used to implement a spectral envelope preprocessor, an integral part of many non-intrusive load monitoring workflows that extracts relevant harmonic information and provides significant data reduction. A robust approach to spectral envelope calculation is presented using a 4-parameter sinusoid fit.

A new physically-windowed sensor architecture for improving the dynamic range of non-intrusive data acquisition is also presented and demonstrated. The hardware architecture utilizes digital techniques and physical cancellation to track a large-scale main signal while maintaining the ability to capture small-scale variations.},

One approach in the domestic sector is to improve consumer understanding of how much energy is consumed by each of their household appliances. This empowers consumers to make educated decisions on how they can change their lifestyle in an effort to reduce their energy consumption. This report investigates how total household energy consumption can be disaggregated into individual appliances using low granularity data collected from a single point of measurement, such as a smart meter. First, this work discusses how this problem can be solved using combinatorial optimisation. Second, a novel approach is introduced using hidden Markov models to model each appliance. We show through empirical evaluation that our implementation of the hidden Markov model approach outperforms the combinatorial optimisation method. Our future work is then outlined to show how we plan to better model domestic appliances and therefore improve the accuracy of our approach.},

  abstract =    {Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) is the process of disaggregating a household’s total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances. Smart meters are currently being deployed on national scales, providing a platform to collect aggregate household electricity consumption data. Existing approaches to NIALM require a manual training phase in which either sub-metered appliance data is collected or appliance usage is manually labelled. This training data is used to build models of the house- hold appliances, which are subsequently used to disaggregate the household’s electricity data. Due to the requirement of such a training phase, existing approaches do not scale automatically to the national scales of smart meter data currently being collected.

In this thesis we propose an unsupervised training method which, unlike existing approaches, does not require a manual training phase. Instead, our approach combines general appliance knowledge with just aggregate smart meter data from the household to perform disaggregation. To do so, we address the following three problems: (i) how to generalise the behaviour of multiple appliances of the same type, (ii) how to tune general knowledge of appliances to the specific appliances within a single household using only smart meter data, and (iii) how to provide actionable energy saving advice based on the tuned appliance knowledge.

First, we propose an approach to the appliance generalisation problem, which uses the Tracebase data set to build probabilistic models of household appliances. We take a Bayesian approach to modelling appliances using hidden Markov models, and empirically evaluate the extent to which they generalise to previously unseen appliances through cross validation. We show that learning using multiple appliances vastly outperforms learning from a single appliance by 61–99% when attempting to generalise to a previously unseen appliance, and furthermore that such general models can be learned from only 2–6 appliances.

Second, we propose an unsupervised solution to the model tuning problem, which uses only smart meter data to learn the behaviour of the specific appliances in a given house-hold. Our approach uses general appliance models to extract appliance signatures from ￼a household’s smart meter data, which are then used to refine the general appliance models. We evaluate the benefit of this process using the Reference Energy Disaggregation Data set, and show that the tuned appliance models more accurately represent the energy consumption behaviour of a given household’s appliances compared to when general appliance models are used, and furthermore that such general models can per- form comparably to when sub-metered data is used for model training. We also show that our tuning approach outperforms the current state of the art, which uses a factorial hidden Markov model to tune the general appliance models.

Third, we apply both of these approaches to infer the energy efficiency of refrigerators and freezers in a data set of 117 households. We evaluate the accuracy of our approach, and show that it is able to successfully infer the energy efficiency of combined fridge freezers. We then propose an extension to our model tuning process using factorial hidden semi-Markov models to model households with a separate fridge and freezer. Finally, we show that through this extension our approach is able to simultaneously tune the appliance models of both appliances.

The above contributions provide a solution which satisfies the requirements of a NIALM training method which is both unsupervised (no manual interaction required during training) and uses only smart meter data (no installation of additional hardware is required). When combined, the contributions presented in this thesis represent an advancement in the state of the art in the field of non-intrusive appliance load monitoring, and a step towards increasing the efficiency of energy consumption within households.},

In recent years, a number of data sets have been released in order to evaluate such approaches, which contain both building-level and appliance-level energy data. However, these data sets typically cover less than 10 households due to the financial cost of such deployments, and are not released in a format which allows the data sets to be easily used by energy disaggregation researchers. To this end, the Dataport database was created by Pecan Street Inc, which contains 1 minute circuit-level and building-level electricity data from 722 households. Furthermore, the non-intrusive load monitoring toolkit (NILMTK) was released in 2014, which provides software infrastructure to support energy disaggregation research, such as data set parsers, benchmark disaggregation algorithms and accuracy metrics. This paper describes the release of a subset of the Dataport database in NILMTK format, containing one month of electricity data from 669 households. Through the release of this Dataport data in NILMTK format, we pose a challenge to the signal processing community to produce energy disaggregation algorithms which are both accurate and scalable.},

  abstract =     {Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring is the process of disaggregating a household's total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances. In this paper we propose an unsupervised training method for non-intrusive monitoring which, unlike existing supervised approaches, does not require training data to be collected by sub-metering individual appliances, nor does it require appliances to be manually labelled for the households in which disaggregation is performed. Instead, we propose an approach which combines a one-off supervised learning process over existing labelled appliance data sets, with an unsupervised learning method over unlabelled household aggregate data. First, we propose an approach which uses the Tracebase data set to build probabilistic appliance models which generalise to previously unseen households, which we empirically evaluate through cross validation. Second, we use the Reference Energy Disaggregation Data set to evaluate the accuracy with which these general models can be tuned to the appliances within a specific household using only aggregate data. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that general appliance models can be constructed using data from only a small number of appliances (typically 3–6 appliances), and furthermore that 28–99% of the remaining behaviour which is specific to a single household can be learned using only aggregate data from existing smart meters.},

Rather, our sensor system offers contactless operation by simply placing it on the outside of the breaker panel in a home. Although there are a number of existing commercial systems for gathering energy use in a home, almost none can easily and safely be installed by a homeowner (especially for homes in the U.S.). Our approach leverages advances in magnetoresistive materials and circuit design to allow contactless operation by reliably sensing the magnetic field induced by the 60 Hz current and a closed loop circuit allows us to precisely infer the power consumption in real-time. The contribution of this work is an enabling technology for researchers in the fields of Ubiquitous Computing and Human-Computer Interaction wanting to conduct practical large-scale deployments of end-user-deployable energy monitoring applications.

Many existing systems for detecting occupant activity require large numbers of sensors, invasive vision systems, or extensive installation procedures. We present an approach that uses a single plug-in sensor to detect a variety of electrical events throughout the home. This sensor detects the electrical noise on residential power lines created by the abrupt switching of electrical devices and the noise created by certain devices while in operation. We use machine learning techniques to recognize electrically noisy events such as turning on or off a particular light switch, a television set, or an electric stove. We tested our system in one home for several weeks and in five homes for one week each to evaluate the system performance over time and in different types of houses. Results indicate that we can learn and classify various electrical events with accuracies ranging from 85-90%.},

We frame the electricity disaggregation problem as that of event detection and event classification from time series data. We use existing shapelet-based algorithms to separate appliance activity periods (caused by switching on/off of appliances and denoted as events) from time periods without any such activity. We then identify which type of appliances in a household correspond to the events detected within the power consumption data. Such appliance-level feedback is critical for end-users in managing their energy use efficiently. We use the BLUED dataset for experimental evaluation of the proposed method. This dataset is a fully labeled publicly available dataset of electricity consumption of a household in the United States for one week, the data being recorded at a very high frequency and externally labeled with the times when specific appliances were switched on or off. The proposed approach is able to achieve approximately 98% accuracy for event detection and between 77% to 84% accuracy for event classification. The data segments that were identified as being most discriminative for electricity disaggregation are visually interpretable, and the appliances identified to be responsible for heavy energy consumption can be reported to consumers to encourage reduction in energy consumption.},

  abstract =     {Evidence-based policy is a dominant theme in contemporary public services but the practical realities and challenges involved in using evidence in policy-making are formidable. Part of the problem is one of complexity. In health services and other public services, we are dealing with complex social interventions which act on complex social systems--things like league tables, performance measures, regulation and inspection, or funding reforms. These are not 'magic bullets' which will always hit their target, but programmes whose effects are crucially dependent on context and implementation. Traditional methods of review focus on measuring and reporting on programme effectiveness, often find that the evidence is mixed or conflicting, and provide little or no clue as to why the intervention worked or did not work when applied in different contexts or circumstances, deployed by different stakeholders, or used for different purposes. This paper offers a model of research synthesis which is designed to work with complex social interventions or programmes, and which is based on the emerging 'realist' approach to evaluation. It provides an explanatory analysis aimed at discerning what works for whom, in what circumstances, in what respects and how. The first step is to make explicit the programme theory (or theories)--the underlying assumptions about how an intervention is meant to work and what impacts it is expected to have. We then look for empirical evidence to populate this theoretical framework, supporting, contradicting or modifying the programme theories as it goes. The results of the review combine theoretical understanding and empirical evidence, and focus on explaining the relationship between the context in which the intervention is applied, the mechanisms by which it works and the outcomes which are produced. The aim is to enable decision-makers to reach a deeper understanding of the intervention and how it can be made to work most effectively. Realist review does not provide simple answers to complex questions. It will not tell policy-makers or managers whether something works or not, but will provide the policy and practice community with the kind of rich, detailed and highly practical understanding of complex social interventions which is likely to be of much more use to them when planning and implementing programmes at a national, regional or local level.},

Although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Cenozoic era (about 60 Myr ago) are widely believed to have been higher than at present, there is disagreement regarding the exact carbon dioxide levels, the timing of the decline and the mechanisms that are most important for the control of CO2 concentrations over geological timescales. Here we use the boron-isotope ratios of ancient planktonic foraminifer shells to estimate the pH of surface-layer sea water throughout the past 60 million years, which can be used to reconstruct atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We estimate CO2 concentrations of more than 2,000 p.p.m. for the late Palaeocene and earliest Eocene periods (from about 60 to 52 Myr ago), and find an erratic decline between 55 and 40 Myr ago that may have been caused by reduced CO2 outgassing from ocean ridges, volcanoes and metamorphic belts and increased carbon burial. Since the early Miocene (about 24 Myr ago), atmospheric CO2 concentrations appear to have remained below 500 p.p.m. and were more stable than before, although transient intervals of CO2 reduction may have occurred during periods of rapid cooling approximately 15 and 3 Myr ago.},

The effects of these changes in our eco-system are hard to assess, therefore encouraging researchers from different fields to conduct studies with the goal of understanding and improving perceptions and behaviors regarding household energy consumption. While several of these studies report success in increasing awareness, most of them are limited to short periods of time, thus resulting in a reduced knowledge of how householders will behave in the long-term. In this paper we attempt to reduce this gap presenting a long-term study on household electricity consumption. We deployed a real-time non-intrusive energy monitoring and eco-feedback system in 12 families during 52 weeks. Results show an increased awareness regarding electricity consumption despite a significant decrease in interactions with the eco-feedback system over time. We conclude that after one year of deployment of eco-feedback it was not possible to see any significant increase or decrease in the household consumption. Our results also confirm that consumption is tightly coupled with independent variables like the household size and the income-level of the families.},

Air-conditioning (A/C) use can be determined through non-intrusive load monitoring, which separates A/C cooling energy consumption from whole-house energy data. In this paper, a disaggregation technique is described and executed on 1-min smart meter data from 88 houses in Austin, TX, USA, from July 2012 through June 2013. Nineteen houses were sub-metered to validate the accuracy of the disaggregation technique. The \{R2\} value between the predicted and actual A/C energy use for the 19 houses was 0.90. The algorithm was then applied to all houses. On average, daily energy use from A/C increased by 25 ± 11 kWh between a mild temperature day of 15.5 °C (60 °F) and a hotter day of 31.5 °C (89 °F), with an 11 kWh increase just during peak hours (14:00–20:00). Average time operated, number of cycles, and A/C fraction of energy were found to increase linearly with outdoor temperature up to 25 °C (77 °F); a plateau was detected at higher temperatures. The accuracy of A/C disaggregation on 5-min data was found to be comparable to 1-min data. However, 15-min data did not yield accurate results due to insufficient granularity.},

Noting the climate change becomes an important issue the whole world is currently facing, the ever increasing price of petroleum products and the reduction in cost of renewable energy power systems, opportunities for renewable energy systems to address electricity generation seems to be increasing. However, to achieve commercialization and widespread use, an efficient energy management strategy of system needs to be addressed. Recently, the concept of smart grid has been successfully applied to the electric power systems. This paper presents the study of integrating renewable energy in smart grid system. The introductory sections provide the role of renewable energy and distributed generation in smart grid system. Subsequent sections cover the concept of smart grid as well as benefits and barrier of smart grid renewable energy system. Pricing is a significant variable in success of renewable energy promotion. Thus, it is important to gain insight to renewable energy pricing by considering unique characteristics associated with renewable energy alternatives. A review of work done in renewable smart grid systems in recent years indicates the promising potential of such research characteristics in the future. This would be useful to developers and practitioners of renewable energy systems and to policy makers.},

  abstract =     {Retrieving the household electricity consumption at individual appliance level is an essential requirement to assess the contribution of different end uses to the total household consumption, and thus to design energy saving policies and user-tailored feedback for reducing household electricity usage. This has led to the development of nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM), or energy disaggregation, algorithms, which aim to decompose the aggregate energy consumption data collected from a single measurement point into device-level consumption estimations. Existing NIALM algorithms are able to provide accurate estimate of the fraction of energy consumed by each appliance. Yet, in the authors' experience, they provide poor performance in reconstructing the power consumption trajectories overtime. In this brief, a new NIALM algorithm is presented, which, besides providing very accurate estimates of the aggregated consumption by appliance, also accurately characterizes the appliance power consumption profiles overtime. The proposed algorithm is based on the assumption that the unknown appliance power consumption profiles are piecewise constant overtime (as it is typical for power use patterns of household appliances) and it exploits the information on the time-of-day probability in which a specific appliance might be used. The disaggregation problem is formulated as a least-square error minimization problem, with an additional (convex) penalty term aiming at enforcing the disaggregate signals to be piecewise constant overtime. Testing on household electricity data available in the literature is reported.},

We present an information coding perspective of load disaggregation to enable a better understanding of this process and support its future improvement. In typical cases of quantity and types of devices and their respective power consumption, not all possible device configurations can be mapped to distinguishable power values. We introduce the term proficiency to describe the suitability of a device set for load disaggregation. We provide the notion and calculation of entropy of the initial device states, mutual information of power values, and the resulting uncertainty coefficient or proficiency. We show that the proficiency is highly dependent on the device running probability, especially for devices with multiple states of power consumption. The application of the concept is demonstrated by artificial data as well as with actual power consumption data from real-world power draw data sets.},

Putting this into perspective requires information on the history of Arctic sea-ice conditions through the geologic past. This information can be provided by proxy records from the Arctic Ocean floor and from the surrounding coasts. Although existing records are far from complete, they indicate that sea ice became a feature of the Arctic by 47 Ma, following a pronounced decline in atmospheric pCO2 after the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Optimum, and consistently covered at least part of the Arctic Ocean for no less than the last 13–14 million years. Ice was apparently most widespread during the last 2–3 million years, in accordance with Earth's overall cooler climate. Nevertheless, episodes of considerably reduced sea ice or even seasonally ice-free conditions occurred during warmer periods linked to orbital variations. The last low-ice event related to orbital forcing (high insolation) was in the early Holocene, after which the northern high latitudes cooled overall, with some superimposed shorter-term (multidecadal to millennial-scale) and lower-magnitude variability. The current reduction in Arctic ice cover started in the late 19th century, consistent with the rapidly warming climate, and became very pronounced over the last three decades. This ice loss appears to be unmatched over at least the last few thousand years and unexplainable by any of the known natural variabilities. },

  abstract =    {Britain’s smart meter upgrade is gathering pace, and those who’ve already
got their smart meter are giving the technology a big thumbs-up.
This report for Smart Energy GB, conducted by independent research
company Populus, has found that 84 per cent of people with smart meters
would recommend one to others.

Smart meters will bring an end to estimated bills and provide accurate
information about what we’re spending in pounds and pence in near real
time. Helping us all to use the amount of energy we want, without worrying
about the shock of an unknown bill.

Smart meters will also open the door to smarter grids and future innovation
with smart appliances and tariffs. The national upgrade represents a vital
digitisation of the energy industry, replacing analogue technology which
creates confusion and inaccuracy – the mechanical meters that haven’t
changed much since the 19th century.

Every home and microbusiness in Great Britain will have the opportunity
to upgrade to a smart meter by 2020. Smart meters will be installed by
energy suppliers, at no extra cost to consumers, and more than 1.6 million
have already been fitted across Scotland, England and Wales.

Smart energy outlook is published twice a year by Smart Energy GB. The
research is a snapshot of the real views and experiences of the British
public: how they feel about their gas and electricity, how those who already
have their smart meters are finding the new technology, and the impact
this transformation of our national infrastructure is having on their lives.

Key findings:
• More than eight in ten (84 per cent) of people with a smart meter
would recommend one to others.
• Nearly eight in ten (79 per cent) of smart meter customers have taken
steps to use less energy such as turning off lights, turning their heating
down or changing the way they use household appliances.
• People with smart meters feel more informed and in control of their
energy use. More than eight in ten (82 per cent) feel they have a better
idea of what they are spending on energy and nearly seven in ten (69
per cent) say they are more conscious about the energy that they use.
• Smart meter customers are also more confident in the accuracy of
their bills. Nearly four in five (79 per cent) believe that their energy bills
are accurate, whereas only 59 per cent of those without a smart meter
feel the same.

Research methodology: Populus conducted 10,101 interviews using a bespoke online survey, designed to be representative of the population in Great Britain. The
interviews took place between 18th May and 1st June 2015.},

especially in the morning and evening peak load periods. This has given rise to growing efforts to
improve household energy management and energy efficiency through initiatives such as minimum

consumer education. A considerable number of energy management and energy auditing software
applications, including online web applications, have been developed in recent years to educate
residential consumers in energy management matters. Generally, the system topology of an online
web application features a browser-driven user interface that connects to a remote database server
that maintains up-to-date information of appliance performance specifications and user system
information.
This paper discusses the development of an interactive rich internet application for residential energy
auditing that implements a hybrid database configuration consisting of a remote relational database
backend in combination with a local SQLite database structure. This hybrid database topology offers
a number of distinct advantages, including increased security of user data, the possibility of offline
system configuration and auditing functions, reduced network traffic, substantial simplification of the
user management system on the remote server and improved scalability.
The optimal design of the local and remote database structures is discussed and the demarcation of
functionality between the local application and the remote server is investigated. The data exchange
protocol for communication between the local and remote is introduced and discussed from a
performance perspective. Requirements for cross-platform support and compatibility among the
contributing technologies are examined.},

  abstract =     {The smart metering systems currently being installed in UK households support devices that give feedback aimed at encouraging behaviour changes, specifically to reduce energy demand and spending on energy. Detailed standards specify the minimum technical capabilities of the smart meters and feedback devices. In this paper, we assess the extent to which these standards enable feedback that is likely to be effective in reducing demand. Latest research in this field, drawing on theories of social practice, suggests that feedback devices assume and rely on what we term ‘reflection practice’, a distinctive type of social practice, and that feedback attentive to the particular energy-using practices of householders is likely to have most influence on demand. Neither the smart meter standards nor current commercial devices are found to incorporate these latest research findings, potentially significantly limiting the ability of the UK smart metering programme to fulfil its domestic energy demand reduction objectives.},

  abstract =     {Endogenous demand responses for energy services, resulting from changing prices, have long been characterised in energy systems models. However, the uncertainty associated with such demand responses, modelled through the use of price elasticities, has often been ignored. This is problematic for two key reasons – elasticity factors used in models are highly uncertain due to the limited evidence base, while at the same time, demand response has been observed as a critical mechanism for meeting long term climate mitigation targets. This paper makes two important contributions for improving the understanding of the role of price-induced demand response. Firstly, it attempts to address the problem of unsatisfactory elasticity input assumptions by undertaking an up-to-date review of the literature. Secondly, the role of demand response under uncertainty is assessed using a probabilistic approach, focusing on its contribution to mitigation. The paper highlights that demand response does play a critical role in mitigation, ensuring a more cost-effective transition to a low carbon energy system. Crucially, the uncertainties associated with price elasticities do not weaken this finding. The transport sector is the driver of this demand response leading to important implications for policy and the focus of demand side interventions.},

The system is implemented on a tablet PC and relies on a non-intrusive energy-monitoring infrastructure to access consumption and power event information. Our prototype addresses an important problem in eco-feedback, which is the fact that users loose interest about their energy consumption after a period of several weeks. To accomplish this HomeTree implements a dual visualization strategy. Initially HomeTree presents users with a screensaver that shows energy consumption mapped in a dynamic illustration of the local forest. Through this strategy we leverage the emotional connection between the short-term energy consumption and the long-term effects on nature through the local depicted landscape. In a second mode of operation users can interact with HomeTree directly by checking the historical records of their consumption data, and check which days or weeks they have reduced or increased consumption. Furthermore a comparison with a more objective baseline, such as the city of Funchal energy consumption is provided, in order to give users a sense of the level of their consumption in a wider context.},

We show that simple discriminative methods can directly predict the appliance states (e.g. on, off, standby) and the predicted state can be used to calculate energy consumed by the appliances. We also show that these methods perform substantially better than the generative models of energy consumption that are commonly used.

Current approaches for appliance-level energy metering typically require the installation of plug-through power meters, which is often difficult and costly for devices with inaccessible wires or outlets, or appliances that draw large amounts of current. In this paper, we present an energy measurement system that estimates the energy consumption of individual appliances using a wireless sensor network consisting of contactless electromagnetic field (EMF) sensors deployed near each appliance, and a whole-house power meter. We present the design of a battery-operated EMF sensor, which can detect appliance state transitions within close proximity based on magnetic and electric field fluctuations. Each detector wirelessly transmits state change events to a circuit-panel energy meter, in a time-synchronized fashion, so that the overall power measurements can be used to estimate appliance-level energy usage. Our EMF sensors are able to detect significant power state changes from a few inches away, thus making it possible to externally monitor in-wall wiring to devices. We experimentally evaluate our proposed EMF sensor, three-phase power meter and communication protocol in a residential building collecting data for over a week. The system is able to detect appliance state transitions with an accuracy of 95.8% and estimate the overall energy with an accuracy of 98.1%.},

Agent-Switch incorporates novel algorithms to make predictions of hourly energy usage as well as detect (and suggest to the user) deferrable loads that could be shifted to off-peak times to maximise savings. To take advantage of group discounts from energy retailers, we develop a new scalable collective energy purchasing mechanism, based on the Shapley value, that ensures individual members of a collective (interacting through AgentSwitch) fairly share the discounts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms we empirically evaluate them individually on real-world data (with up to 3000 homes in the UK) and show that they outperform the state of the art in their domains. Finally, to ensure individual components are accountable in providing recommendations, we provide a novel provenance-tracking service to record of the flow of data in the system, and therefore provide users with a means of checking the provenance of suggestions from AgentSwitch and assess their reliability.},

  abstract =     {Smart grid is a technology for reliable integration and intelligent control of multiple generation units where the loads spread across a non-uniform or a uniform distribution network. The basic frame work of a smart grid is made to ease the complexity of integration of Distributed Renewable Energy Sources (DRES) with greater grid penetration, reduction of transmission losses, optimized energy capacity expansion with better demand side management and hierarchical control for grid security. Smart grids consists of four unique features which can be given as Integration, Control, Communication and Metering (ICCM). Integration refers to connection of heterogeneous type of energy sources with AC or DC grid using appropriate converters. Power output of the DRES is dependent on climatic conditions like wind speed and solar irradiance. Controls in smart grids are made intelligent to extract the maximum power from the sources, operational scheduling of energy sources and overloads, control of transients, real and reactive power. For effective operation of the diverse smart grid, communication between various control nodes is necessary. Communication standards for smart grids usually are set by protocols, and most of them involve the interconnection of Secure Communication Line (SCL) to the main control unit by LAN (Local Area Network), HAN (Home Area Network), and WAN (Wide Area Network). The interconnection should be accompanied with a firewall at various levels for the cyber security of the smart grid. Smart metering employed in smart grids provides additional information of the electrical energy consumed compared to conventional energy meters. Smart metering can measure the energy parameters of the load remotely and transfer the data through the communication network. This paper presents different methods of ICCM in smart grid.},

Historically, the calibration process has been an art form that inevitably relies on user knowledge, past experience, statistical expertise, engineering judgment, and an abundance of trial and error. Unfortunately, despite widespread interest in the professional community, no consensus guidelines have been published on how to perform a calibration using detailed simulation programs. This research project was initiated with the intention to cull the best tools, techniques, approaches, and procedures from the existing body of research and develop a coherent and systematic calibration methodology that includes both parameter estimation and the determination of the uncertainty in the calibrated simulation. A general methodology of calibrating detailed simulation programs to performance data is proposed, which we deem to be methodical, rational, robust, and computationally efficient while being flexible enough to satisfy different users with different personal preferences and biases. The methodology involves various concepts and approaches borrowed from allied scientific disciplines that are also reviewed in this paper. The methodology essentially consists of five parts: (1) identify a building energy program that has the ability to simulate the types of building elements and systems present and set up the simulation input file to be as realistic as possible; (2) depending on the building type, heuristically define a set of influential parameters and schedules that have simple and clear correspondence to specific and easy-to-identify inputs to the simulation program, along with their best-guess estimates and their range of variation; (3) perform a coarse grid search wherein the heuristically defined influential parameters are subject to a Monte Carlo simulation involving thousands of simulation trials from which a small set of promising parameter vector solutions can be identified by filtering, the strong and weak parameters can be identified, and narrower bounds of variability of the strong parameters can be defined; (4) perform a guided grid search to further refine the promising parameter vector solutions; and (5) use this small set of solutions (as opposed to a single calibrated solution) to make predictions about intended changes to the building and its systems, and determine the prediction uncertainty of the entire calibration process. A companion paper (Reddy et al. 2007) will present the results of applying this calibration methodology to two synthetic office buildings and one actual office building. },

Limitations of inexpensive commercial devices such as resolution and measurement accuracy are a challenge. An algorithm currently under development, specifically developed for the low resolution of inexpensive commercial sensor packages, will be discussed and demonstrated. This information can then be used to verify the effectiveness of various smart grid initiatives in addition to other energy saving protocols such as weather proofing and energy efficient appliances. In addition, this information can be used to select devices for distributed control by analyzing not only the type of device but also the real world operating characteristics.},

Appliances should however only be disconnected from mains when no negative side effects, e.g., loss of data or thawing food, are incurred thereby. This motivates the use of appliance identification techniques, which determine the type of an attached appliance based on the continuous sampling of its power consumption. While various implementations based on different sampling resolutions have been presented in existing literature, the achievable classification accuracies have rarely been analyzed. We address this shortcoming and evaluate the accuracy of appliance identification based on the characteristic features of traces collected during the 24 hours of a day. We evaluate our algorithm using more than 1,000 traces of different electrical appliances' power consumptions. The results show that our approach can identify most of the appliances at high accuracy.},

Through their collaborative operation, billions of such devices will realize the vision of smart homes, smart cities, and beyond. Smart electricity meters can, e.g., already help utilities monitor the stability of the power grid by periodically reporting each connected household's energy consumption. Even more sophisticated services can be realized when data is available at higher spatio-temporal resolutions, e.g., when distributed smart power meters (sometimes referred to as smart plugs) are deployed. In this paper, we present one such novel service for the smart home, namely making projections of an appliance's future energy demand based on previously observed power consumption data. In a first step, our system identifies and isolates unique characteristic signatures from collected power consumption traces. Subsequently, time series pattern matching is applied to detect these signatures in real-time data. Based on the occurrences of the extracted signatures in real-time data, the appliance's future power demand is predicted. We evaluate our approach with more than 2,500 appliance activity segments collected from 15 different appliance types, and show that accurate forecasts can be made in many cases.},

  abstract =     {More and more renewable sources are integrated into electric power grids worldwide. Their high generation dynamics, however, require power grid operators to monitor electricity generation and demand at a fine temporal resolution. Even small mismatches between supply and demand can impact the power grid’s stability, and thus ultimately lead to blackouts. As a result, smart metering equipment has been widely deployed to collect real-time information about the current grid load and forward it to utilities in a timely manner. Numerous research works have shown that power consumption data can, however, reveal the nature of used appliances and their mode of operation at high accuracy. This effectively puts user privacy at risk. In this manuscript, we investigate to which extent the local preprocessing of power data can mitigate this risk. We thus compare the efficacy of different preprocessing steps to eliminate characteristic consumption patterns from the data. Our evaluation shows that a combination of these preprocessing steps can provide a balanced trade-off that is in the interests of both users (privacy protection) and utilities (accurate and timely reporting).},

Changes in lighting and the effects of perspective also pose no problems. How do we achieve this, and more importantly, how can we get a computer to do this? One very promising approach is to find mathematical functions of an object's image, or of an object's 3D description, that are invariant to the transformations caused by the object's motion. This book is devoted to the theory and practice of such invariant image features, so-called image invariants, for planar objects. It gives a comprehensive summary of the field, discussing methods for recognizing both occluded and partially occluded objects, and also contains a definitive treatmentof moment invariants and a tutorial introduction to algebraic invariants, which are fundamental to affine moment invariants and to many projective invariants. A number of novel invariant functions are presented and the results of numerous experiments investigating the stability of new and old invariants are discussed. The main conclusion is that moment invariants are very effective, both for partially occluded objects and for recognizing objects in grey-level images.},

million homes and smaller non-domestic sites in Britain. These smart meters, which will
include an offer of a free in-home-display for households, are intended to allow consumers to
see and adjust in real time what energy they are using.
Ofgem considers that smart metering could “transform how energy markets operate”. The
Government estimates that over the next 20 years, the roll-out of smart meters will deliver
about £7 billion of net benefits to consumers, energy suppliers and networks. Since 2009, DECC and Ofgem have been working on a roll-out programme.
The National Audit Office (NAO) and the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) have raised
concerns about the ambition of the programme, its risks and the extent of the potential
benefits to consumers. In two reports PAC considered the challenges associated with roll-out
‘huge’ and the benefits slim. DECC stated in May 2013 that it now expects suppliers to be
ready to start their full scale roll-out by autumn 2015, for completion by 2020.
Issues that may be of concern to constituents include the extent to which smart meters will
be mandated, consumer protection during the installation process, and concerns about
privacy and access to smart metering data. Suppliers must operate in line with an installation
code of practice which came into force on 1 June 2013, backed by legislation. Among other
things, this bans face-to-face marketing activity of specific products without prior consent
during installations, with a complete ban on completing any sales. On data access, energy
suppliers will be able to access consumption data on a monthly basis, with a clear consumer
opt-out for daily access by suppliers and an opt-in for more frequent access. Concerns have
also been raised by some groups about health effects from smart meters.
The licence conditions for the roll-out of gas and electricity smart metering equipment and a
code of practice for the installation of smart metering equipment came into force on
30 November 2012. Licence conditions relating to other aspects of the smart metering rollout
including a consumer engagement strategy most of those relating to data access and
privacy came into force on 4 March 2013.},

The best combination of features and classifiers shows 93.6% accuracy.},

In this game, machine learning has an important part to play, allowing for energy consumption understanding, critical equipment monitoring and even human activity recognition. This paper provides a survey of current researches on Intrusive Load Monitoring (ILM) techniques. ILM relies on low-end electricity meter devices spread inside the habitations, as opposed to Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) that relies on an unique point of measurement, the smart meter. Potential applications and principles of ILMs are presented and compared to NILM. A focus is also given on feature extraction and machine learning algorithms typically used for ILM applications.},

term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those
attained by other regularized auto-encoders

corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the
Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations

this penalty term results in a localized space
contraction which in turn yields robust features
on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to
both regularized auto-encoders and denoising
auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link
between deterministic and non-deterministic
auto-encoders. We nd empirically that this
penalty helps to carve a representation that
better captures the local directions of variation
dictated by the data, corresponding to a
lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while
being more invariant to the vast majority of
directions orthogonal to the manifold.
Finally, we show that by using the learned

Considerable disparity remains between these estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of each method, the lack of detailed comparison between independent estimates, and the effect of temporal modulations in ice sheet surface mass balance. Here, we present a consistent record of mass balance for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the past two decades, validated by the comparison of two independent techniques over the last 8 years: one differencing perimeter loss from net accumulation, and one using a dense time series of time-variable gravity. We find excellent agreement between the two techniques for absolute mass loss and acceleration of mass loss. In 2006, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets experienced a combined mass loss of 475 ± 158 Gt/yr, equivalent to 1.3 ± 0.4 mm/yr sea level rise. Notably, the acceleration in ice sheet loss over the last 18 years was 21.9 ± 1 Gt/yr2 for Greenland and 14.5 ± 2 Gt/yr2 for Antarctica, for a combined total of 36.3 ± 2 Gt/yr2. This acceleration is 3 times larger than for mountain glaciers and ice caps (12 ± 6 Gt/yr2). If this trend continues, ice sheets will be the dominant contributor to sea level rise in the 21st century.},

bills, provide the users with a much finer resolution time series of energy usage. However, apart
from identifying times of peak energy usage, these smart meters provide little actionable data for
the user in terms of reducing their power costs. Our research involves the development of an
intelligent metering system that uses non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) to
identify the largest energy usage appliances in a residence or small business. The signal
processing algorithms employed separate the energy used by individual appliances from the total
natural gas and electricity measured at the point where the utilities enter the residence. Utility
ratepayers need detailed information to effectively identify and mitigate inefficient appliances
and activities. The cost to operate each specific appliance is sent, via a secure home area
network, to the user’s computer and accessed via a web browser. An easy to use interactive tool
has been developed to label appliances and present this data to the user. Tests have been
performed in three residences to compare the performance of our load disaggregation system
with that of isolated electrical power measurements from ten or more appliances. Disaggregating
the total energy usage into appliance specific usage will transform ratepayers’ ability to conserve
energy. Inefficient appliances can be identified, usage patterns can be shifted to lower tariffs
times, failing appliances can be detected before they fail, and energy efficient measures can be
implemented based on a true cost-benefit calculation.},

The implementation of classification capability in future transient recorders will enable such features as selective storage of transient data (to better utilize limited storage media) and automated reporting of disturbances to central control facilities. The wavelet transform provides an effective and efficient means of decomposing voltage and current signals of power system transients to detectable and discriminant features. Similarities of power system transients to wide-band signals in other domains, the simultaneous presence of a resonant frequency, its harmonics, and impulse (high-frequency, time-localized) components, make this technique extendible to other classification systems. The classification algorithm uses statistical pattern recognition on features derived from the extreme representation of the transient waveform after processing the transient waveform by a non-orthogonal, quadratic spline wavelet. Training and classification testing use simulated waveforms of a 200 mile, three-phase transmission line produced by the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). A simple Bayesian classifier identifies an unknown transient waveform as a capacitor switching or fault transient, and locates the point of disturbance from one of two possible locations on the transmission line. Due to the effectiveness of the wavelet transform preprocessing, the classification system currently performs at 100 percent accuracy on four transient classes.},

Training via backpropagation-through-time initially minimizes an unsupervised sparse reconstruction error; the loss function is then augmented with a discriminative term on the supervised classification. The depth implicit in the temporally-unrolled form allows the system to exhibit all the power of deep networks, while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters.
From an initially unstructured network the hidden units differentiate into categorical-units, each of which represents an input prototype with a well-defined class; and part-units representing deformations of these prototypes. The learned organization of the recurrent encoder is hierarchical: part-units are driven directly by the input, whereas the activity of categorical-units builds up over time through interactions with the part-units. Even using a small number of hidden units per layer, discriminative recurrent sparse auto-encoders achieve excellent performance on MNIST.},

Demand side energy control also forms an important part in the research programs of many research organisations. Reliable data on energy consumption is therefore imperative for effective research in this field, as well as for the successful implementation of demand side management. Traditional load research instrumentation has involved intrusive techniques that require the installation of sensors on each of the individual components of the total load. A non-intrusive appliance load monitor is proposed in this paper to determine the energy consumption of individual appliances turning on or off or operating under continuously varying load conditions. This monitoring system, which is implemented by network pattern identification technology, is based on detailed analysis of the current and voltage of the total load, as measured at the interface of the power source. The approach has been developed to simplify the collection of energy consumption data by utilities, but also has other applications. It is called nonintrusive to contrast it with previous techniques for gathering appliance data, which require placing sensors on individual appliances, and hence an intrusion onto the energy consumer's property.},

On the other hand, aggregated measurements about consumption are crucial for several goals, including resource provisioning, forecasting, and monitoring. This paper proposes a framework for allowing information Consumers, such as utilities and third parties, to collect data with different levels of spatial and temporal aggregation from smart meters without revealing information about individual customers. The proposed infrastructure introduces a new set of functional nodes, namely the Privacy Preserving Nodes (PPNs), which collect customer data masked by means of a secret sharing scheme with homomorphic properties, and aggregate them directly in the masked domain, according to the Consumer's needs and access rights. The information Consumers can recover the aggregated data by collecting multiple shares from the PPNs. The paper describes an Integer Linear Programming formulation and a greedy algorithm to address the problem of deploying the information flows between the information Producers (i.e. the customers), the PPNs, and the Consumers and evaluates the scalability of the infrastructure both under the assumption that the communication network is reliable and timely and in presence of communication errors.},

The authors propose a formal description of the FSM and its output, using a regular phrase-structured grammar. This description is associated with a cost measuring its information content. The authors then state the inference problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with an objective function define as the cost of the description of the FSM and its output. A heuristic algorithm is proposed which processes the output âon lineâ and yields a local minimum of the authors' criterion. At each step (i.e. as new data is observed and processed), the procedure searches locally through the space of non-probabilistic FSMs, i.e., the transitions are initially regarded as being only present or absent. When a non-probabilistic model has been generated, the transition probabilities are determined from their relative frequencies given the behavior indicated by the data. This yields maximum likelihood estimates of the probabilities. The costs of the obtained probabilistic FSMs are then computed, and the K minimum cost FSMs are kept as starting points for the next step search. At each step, the generation of the FSMs is done via a local search through the neighborhoods of the K best FSMs obtained at the previous step. This algorithm is compared with similar algorithms proposed previously, and tested on a range of examples. It is found to work for a wider range of FSMs than the previous methods, and it is much more practical for large problems than previously proposed exhaustive search techniques},

In this paper, we present an inexpensive contactless electromagnetic field (EMF) event-detector that can detect appliance state changes within close proximity based on magnetic and electric field fluctuations. Each detector wirelessly transmits state changes to a circuit-panel energy meter, which can then be used to label and disambiguate appliance transitions detected from the aggregate signals as well as to track the associated energy consumption. Our EMF sensors are able to detect significant power state changes from a few inches away making it possible to externally monitor in-wall wiring to devices (e.g., overhead lights). We experimentally evaluate our proposed EMF sensor in terms of power consumption, accuracy and detection range on a variety of appliances to demonstrate its effectiveness towards augmenting NILM systems. We show that accurately detecting 100W loads from 10cm away is possible while maintaining multiple-year battery life from a coin-cell battery.},

  abstract =     {To promote energy-efficient operations in residential and office buildings, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques have been proposed to infer the fine-grained power consumption and usage patterns of appliances from power-line measurement data. Fine-grained monitoring of everyday appliances (such as toasters and coffee makers) can not only promote energy-efficient building operations, but also provide unique insights into the context and activities of individuals. Current building-level NILM techniques are unable to identify the consumption characteristics of relatively low-load appliances, whereas smart-plug based solutions incur significant deployment and maintenance costs. In this paper, we investigate an intermediate architecture, where smart circuit breakers provide measurements of aggregate power consumption at room (or section) level granularity. We then investigate techniques to identify the usage and energy consumption of individual appliances from such measurements. We first develop a novel correlation-based approach called CBPA to identify individual appliances based on both their unique transient and steady-state power signatures. While promising, CBPA fails when the set of candidate appliances is too large. To further improve the accuracy of appliance level usage estimation, we then propose a hybrid system called AARPA, which uses mobile sensing to first infer high-level activities of daily living (ADLs), and then uses knowledge of such ADLs to effectively reduce the set of candidate appliances that potentially contribute to the aggregate readings at any point. We evaluate two variants of this algorithm, and show, using real-life data traces gathered from 10 domestic users, that our fusion of mobile and power-line sensing is very promising: it identified all devices that were used in each data trace, and it identified the usage duration and energy consumption of low-load consumer appliances with ∼ 87 % accuracy.},

  abstract =     {The exploitation of renewable energy resources poses great challenges regarding the manner in which they can be integrated into the modern electrical distribution infrastructure. To understand the difficulties of integration of Distributed Generation (DG) in electricity distribution network, the analyses and result of the effects on aspects of power quality are provided, as can be the problem of failure defects in networks and how DG grid connection affects voltage control at both medium-voltage (MV) and low-voltage (LV) levels. Results demonstrated that there was a communication system between all generators protective systems, a selective protective system, a tracking of perturbations system to isolate failure defects, and a phase control system between the generators and the network. Also synchronizing voltage regulation is crucial for guaranteeing the quality of the power supply. Currently, recent and modern technologies allow different services to share a single communications infrastructure while guaranteeing the required levels of security, reliability, and efficiency. This paper aims to provide a Smart City (SC) project, implemented in the city of Malaga, Spain, where the integration of the applications of Smart Grid (SG) and the Use Cases (UCs) for the different functionalities of SG has been developed. The SC architecture proposed envisions a hierarchical, distributed, and autonomous structure to address the challenge of smart distribution grids. As a result of this project, new levels of standardization of languages and protocols and new interconnection functions will be required. These functions will allow smart devices to recognize each other so that they can reconnect in case of failure regardless of the state of the network topology. In conclusion, renewable energy sources (RES) can be optimally integrated into the distribution grid. Generation can approach consumption through the installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels and mini-wind generators, with the reuse of electrical infrastructure.},

  abstract =  {Sensing, monitoring and actuating systems are expected to play a key role in reducing buildings overall energy consumption. Leveraging sensor systems to support energy efficiency in buildings poses novel research challenges in monitoring space usage, controlling devices, interfacing with smart energy meters and communicating with the energy grid. In the attempt of reducing electricity consumption in buildings, identifying individual sources of energy consumption is key to generate energy awareness and improve efficiency of available energy resources usage. Previous work studied several non-intrusive load monitoring techniques to classify appliances; however, the literature lacks of an comprehensive system that can be easily installed in existing buildings to empower users profiling, benchmarking and recognizing loads in real-time. This has been a major reason holding back the practice adoption of load monitoring techniques. In this paper we present RECAP: RECognition of electrical Appliances and Profiling in real-time. RECAP uses a single wireless energy monitoring sensor easily clipped to the main electrical unit. The energy monitoring unit transmits energy data wirelessly to a local machine for data processing and storage. The RECAP system consists of three parts: (1) Guiding the user for profiling electrical appliances within premises and generating a database of unique appliance signatures; (2) Using those signatures to train an artificial neural network that is then employed to recognize appliance activities (3) Providing a Load descriptor to allow peer appliance benchmarking. RECAP addresses the need of an integrated and intuitive tool to empower building owners with energy awareness. Enabling real-time appliance recognition is a stepping-stone towards reducing energy consumption and allowing a number of major applications including load-shifting techniques, energy expenditure breakdown per appliance, detection of power hungry and faulty appliances, and recognition of occupant activity. This paper describes the system design and performance evaluation in domestic environment.},

  abstract =  {Inferring human activity is of interest for various ubiquitous computing applications, particularly if it can be done using ambient information that can be collected non intrusively. In this paper, we explore human activity inference, in the context of energy consumption within a home, where we define an "activity" as the usage of an electrical appliance, its usage duration and its location. We also explore the dimension of identifying the occupant who performed the activity. Our goal is to answer questions such as "Who is watching TV in the Dining Room and during what times?". This information is particularly important for scenarios such as the apportionment of energy use to individuals in shared settings for better understanding of occupant's energy consumption behavioral patterns. Unfortunately, accurate activity inference in realistic settings is challenging, especially when considering ease of deployment. One of the key differences between our work and prior research in this space is that we seek to combine readily available sensor data (i.e. home level electricity meters and sensors on smartphones carried by the occupants) and metadata information (e.g. appliance power ratings and their location) for activity inference. Our proposed EnergyLens system intelligently fuses electricity meter data with sensors on commodity smartphones -- the Wifi radio and the microphone -- to infer, with high accuracy, which appliance is being used, when its being used, where its being used in the home, and who is using it. EnergyLens exploits easily available metadata to further improve the detection accuracy. Real world experiments show that EnergyLens significantly improves the inference of energy usage activities (average precision= 75.2%, average recall= 77.8%) as compared to traditional approaches that use the meter data only (average precision = 28.4%, average recall = 22.3%).},

  abstract =     {Increasing energy efficiency in households, transportation, industries, and services is an important strategy to reduce energy service demand to levels that allow the steep reduction of greenhouse gases, and a full fledged switch of energy systems to a renewable basis. Yet, technological efficiency improvements may generate so-called rebound effects, which may ‘eat up’ parts of the technical savings potential. This article provides a comprehensive review of existing research on these effects, raises critiques, and points out open questions. It introduces micro-economic rebound effect and suggests extending consumer-side analysis to incorporate potential ‘psychological rebound effects.’ It then discusses meso-economic rebound effects, i.e. producer-side and market-level rebounds, which so far have achieved little attention in the literature. Finally, the article critically reviews evidence for macro-economic rebound effects as energy efficiency-induced economic growth impacts. For all three categories, the article summarizes assessments of their potential quantitative scope, while pointing out remaining methodological weaknesses and open questions. As a rough “rule of thumb”, in the long term and on gross average, only half the technical savings potential of across-the-board efficiency improvements may actually be achieved in the real world. Policies that aim at cutting energy service demand to sustainable levels are well advised to take due note of detrimental behavioral and economic growth impacts, and should foster policies and measures that can contain them.},

However, one third of the European grid investments are delayed, even though the majority of the population in Europe is in favour of a greener energy mix. This paradoxical situation is connected to the fact that although interdependent, the production and transportation sides of renewable energy sources are treated as two distinct processes. The two types of infrastructure undergo separate processes for development consent and are the target of opposition from various citizen groups. In this article we compare the British, Norwegian, and Swedish grid development regimes in order to analyse their opportunities and challenges. The comparison demonstrates that the regimes differ on significant aspects, e.g. different historical trajectories, technological setups, arguments, and main drivers. The article highlights the importance of achieving sustainable energy systems by relying on a sensible strategy for grid development, and the importance of moving beyond the focus on a sustainable, “green-fuelled” grid.},

In this paper, we argue that the required human supervision for profiling and calibrating appliance load monitoring systems is a key reason preventing large-scale commercial roll-outs. We propose ANNOT, a system to automate electricity data annotation leveraging cheap wireless sensor nodes. Characteristic sensory stimuli captured by sensor nodes placed next to appliances are translated into appliance operating state and correlated to the electricity data, autonomously generating the annotation of electricity data with appliance activity. The system is able to facilitate the acquisition of appliance signatures, training data and validate the monitoring output. We validate the concept by integrating the automated annotation system to the RECAP appliance load monitoring system.},

In the upper 400 m, regions of strong seasonal salinity changes differ from regions of strong seasonal temperature changes, and large amplitudes of seasonal salinity are observed in the upper tropical and subpolar global ocean. Strong interannual and decadal changes superimpose long-term changes at northern midlatitudes. In the subtropical and tropical basin, interannual fluctuations dominate the upper 500 m depth. At southern midlatitudes, hydrographic changes occur on interannual and decadal time scales, while long-term changes are predominantly observed in the salinity field. Global mean heat content and steric height changes are clearly associated with a positive trend during the 6 years of measurements. The global 6-year trend of steric height deduced from in situ measurements explains 40% of the satellite-derived quantities. The global freshwater content does not show a significant trend and is dominated by interannual variability.},

  abstract =     {A randomized control field experiment is reported using in-home displays to reduce household electricity consumption. Custom-coded in-home displays (IHDs) were created to provide real-time household electricity consumption feedback, and were framed as either (a) simple kW consumption, or (b) kW consumption and the corresponding cost, or (c) kW consumption and a dynamically-derived social normative frame. Analyses focused on household electricity consumption in the first week following deployment, and again over a 3-month time span. Findings showed that households receiving simple feedback, and feedback framed as cost did not differ significantly from the randomized control at either the 1-week or the 3-month time points. Similarly, results showed that educational materials alone did not reduce electricity consumption. However, significant effects were found for households receiving the normative frame, which consumed 9% less than control households during the initial 1-week evaluation period, and 7% less during the full 3-month evaluation period. Yet despite these findings, residents reported more positive experiences and more obligations to conserve electricity with the cost and feedback IHDs. The results suggest that in-home displays offer promise for encouraging energy conservation, but careful consideration should be given to the way that the feedback is framed.},

We found evidence for a Hawthorne (study participation) effect, seen in a reduction of their electricity use--even though they received no information, instruction, or incentives to change. Responses to a follow-up survey suggested that the effect reflected heightened awareness of energy consumption.

Contrasting with existing research focused on how technology persuades people to consume less energy, our study uses a grounded approach to analyze HEMS emplacement. As an important result, we present here the issue of 'energy literacy'. Our study reveals that, by using HEMS, participants became increasingly literate in understanding domestic electricity consumption. We discuss the role HEMS played in that process and how the acquired literacy changed energy consumption patterns. We conclude that literacy in energy consumption has value on its own and explain how eco feedback system designs can benefit from this understanding.},

  abstract =     {One of the great societal challenges that we face today concerns the move to more sustainable patterns of energy consumption, reflecting the need to balance both individual consumer choice and societal demands. In order for this energy turnaround' to take place, however, reducing residential energy consumption must go beyond using energy-efficient devices: More sustainable behaviour and lifestyles are essential parts of future energy aware' living. Addressing this issue from an HCI perspective, this paper presents the results of a 3-year research project dealing with the co-design and appropriation of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that has been rolled out in a living lab setting with seven households for a period of 18 months. Our HEMS is inspired by feedback systems in Sustainable Interaction Design and allows the monitoring of energy consumption in real-time. In contrast to existing research mainly focusing on how technology can persuade people to consume less energy ( what technology does to people'), our study focuses on the appropriation of energy feedback systems ( what people do with technology') and how newly developed practices can become a resource for future technology design. Therefore, we deliberately followed an open research design. In keeping with this approach, our study uncovers various responses, practices and obstacles of HEMS use. We show that HEMS use is characterized by a number of different features. Recognizing the distinctive patterns of technology use in the different households and the evolutionary character of that use within the households, we conclude with a discussion of these patterns in relation to existing research and their meaning for the design of future HEMSs.},

A range of observations and approaches, including in situ ice thickness measurements, ICESat retrieved ice thickness, and model sensitivity studies, yields a conservative estimate for October Arctic ice volume uncertainty of 1.35 × 103 km3 and an uncertainty of the ice volume trend over the 1979–2010 period of 1.0 × 103 km3 decade–1. A conservative estimate of the trend over this period is −2.8 × 103 km3 decade–1. PIOMAS ice thickness estimates agree well with ICESat ice thickness retrievals (<0.1 m mean difference) for the area for which submarine data are available, while difference outside this area are larger. PIOMAS spatial thickness patterns agree well with ICESat thickness estimates with pattern correlations of above 0.8. PIOMAS appears to overestimate thin ice thickness and underestimate thick ice, yielding a smaller downward trend than apparent in reconstructions from observations. PIOMAS ice volume uncertainties and trends are examined in the context of climate change attribution and the declaration of record minima. The distribution of 32 year trends in a preindustrial coupled model simulation shows no trends comparable to those seen in the PIOMAS retrospective, even when the trend uncertainty is accounted for. Attempts to label September minima as new record lows are sensitive to modeling error. However, the September 2010 ice volume anomaly did in fact exceed the previous 2007 minimum by a large enough margin to establish a statistically significant new record.},

We compared PreHeat's prediction algorithm with a static program over an average 61 days per house, alternating days between these conditions, and measuring actual gas consumption and occupancy. In UK homes PreHeat both saved gas and reduced MissTime (the time that the house was occupied but not warm). In US homes, PreHeat decreased MissTime by a factor of 6-12, while consuming a similar amount of gas. In summary, PreHeat enables more efficient heating while removing the need for users to program thermostat schedules.},

  abstract =     {Power grid operators around the world are facing a number of critical challenges such as energy and peak power shortages, outages and the uncertainty introduced by intermittent renewable energy sources. To address these challenges, the research community has identified a few high-level objectives: alleviation of peak loads, minimization of grid losses, improving the energy efficiency of buildings and loads, and reducing the uncertainty about energy produced by renewable sources. Implementing these strategies would require a “smarter energy” system
that is instrumented, with sensors and controls embedded into the fabric of its operations; it is interconnected, enabling the two-way flow of information—including pricing—and energy across the network; and it is
intelligent, using analytics and automation to achieve the aforementioned objectives.
In this paper, we present a sampling of cyber physical systems we have designed to enable such a smarter energy supply chain. These systems depend on varying levels of instrumentation (sensing/actuation) and network connectivity. There remains a large opportunity to deepen these contributions and taking innovations to full market impact, which require overcoming commercial and regulatory challenges as well. A feature of our work was to consider and be informed of real world and client constraints in our work, and we have built prototypes and experiments for similar circumstances. We hope that these experiences will spark more experimental innovation activity that is critically important for being well grounded in research and indeed, for the success of smart grids worldwide.},

But recent studies are showing that the tropics are also changing. Several lines of evidence show that over the past few decades the tropical belt has expanded. This expansion has potentially important implications for subtropical societies and may lead to profound changes in the global climate system. Most importantly, poleward movement of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as jet streams and storm tracks, could result in shifts in precipitation patterns affecting natural ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources. The implications of the expansion for stratospheric circulation and the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere are as yet poorly understood. The observed recent rate of expansion is greater than climate model projections of expansion over the twenty-first century, which suggests that there is still much to be learned about this aspect of global climate change.},

In this book Dr Shapiro presents a new computer vision framework for interpreting time-varying imagery. This is an important task, since movement reveals valuable information about the environment. The fully-automated system operates on long, monocular image sequences containing multiple, independently-moving objects, and demonstrates the practical feasibility of recovering scene structure and motion in a bottom-up fashion. Real and synthetic examples are given throughout, with particular emphasis on image coding applications. Novel theory is derived in the context of the affine camera, a generalisation of the familiar scaled orthographic model. Analysis proceeds by tracking 'corner features' through successive frames and grouping the resulting trajectories into rigid objects using new clustering and outlier rejection techniques. The three-dimensional motion parameters are then computed via affine epipolar geometry, and affine structure is used to generate alternative views of the object and fill in partial views. The use of all available features (over multiple frames) and the incorporation of statistical noise properties substantially improves existing algorithms, giving greater reliability and reduced noise sensitivity.},

More importantly, with integration of advanced computing and communication technologies, the smart meter (SM) is expected to greatly enhance efficiency and reliability of future power systems with renewable energy resources, as well as distributed intelligence and demand response. Different electrical energy metering standards are point of concern for power/energy measurements. As measurement standards are formed, systems built around them can become interoperable from a standards point of view but still have incompatible configurations or different maturity levels, or include non-standardized functions. Even in areas that are standardized, there are sometimes implementation decisions that can result in different measurement and security behavior. With this paper we make three contributions: firstly, we identify various 1-channel and 3-channel metrology integrated circuits (ICs), which are mandatory for the standard measurement of distributed and renewable electricity generation. Secondly, we describe harmonics effect on metrology, which impacts on reliability of widespread smart metering infrastructure. Finally, we develop and describe a comprehensive set of security issues for SMs. Specifically, we focus on reviewing and discussing smart metrology meter (SMM) applications (i.e. metrological functions and real-time monitoring functions), security requirements, network vulnerabilities, attack countermeasures, secure communication protocols required in smart grid (SG) architectures. This review will enable the researchers, public policy makers and stakeholders to open the mind to explore possible in an evolving energy domain as well as beyond this area.},

Estimates of spectral content in measured waveforms can be used to determine in real time the operating schedule of loads at a target site. Techniques for transient event detection are reviewed. These techniques can detect the turn-on and turn-off transients of individual loads, and can be used to easily determine the energy usage of loads that draw constant power in steady-state operation. Techniques for monitoring the power consumption of smoothly varying loads (e.g., variable speed drives) using spectral estimates are also discussed.},

Measurements of the stator currents and voltages are required for the identification procedure, but no measurements from the motor shaft are needed. The first method presented applies simple models with limited temporal domains of validity and obtains parameter estimates by extrapolating the model error bias to zero. This method does not minimize any specific error criterion and is presented as a means of finding a good initial guess for a conventional iterative maximum-likelihood or least-squares estimator. The second method presented minimizes equation errors in the induction motor model in the least-square sense using a Levenburg-Marquardt iteration. The third identification method is a continuation of the Levenburg-Marquardt method, motivated by observed properties of some pathological loss functions. The third method minimizes errors in the observations in the least-squared sense and is, therefore, a maximum-likelihood estimator under appropriate conditions of normality. The performance of the identification schemes is demonstrated with both simulated and measured data, and parameters obtained using the methods are compared with parameters obtained from standard tests},

  abstract =     {Generally speaking, energy monitoring system plays an important role in both energy use benchmarking and energy conservation service for large-scale buildings. However, it is often necessary for us to disaggregate the metered data according to types of energy use. Aiming at eliminating unclear concepts between monitoring and disaggregation and incorporating existing algorithms’ advantages into the process in which this estimation is generated, the optimal disaggregation algorithm is developed. Based on the assumption of mutually independent ends, a Bayes process is degenerated into maximization likelihood estimation. Following this, the process is expressed by the least squares. With a new algorithm, an unbiased and overall convergent posterior estimation is provided for each terminal category, which is powerfully supported by theoretical analyses and numerical calculation. Actually, it is proved that the disaggregation algorithm is quite appropriate and cost-efficient for sub-item energy monitoring systems in large-scale buildings. Meanwhile, this thesis also focuses on discussing the conditional probability of overall lessening estimation errors specifically. In this way, posterior estimations of overall accuracy are available when prior estimations are concordantly biased with much different accuracy.},

This task is particularly important for matching images across visual domains, such as photos taken over different seasons or lighting conditions, paintings, hand-drawn sketches, etc. We propose a surprisingly simple method that estimates the relative importance of different features in a query image based on the notion of "data-driven uniqueness". We employ standard tools from discriminative object detection in a novel way, yielding a generic approach that does not depend on a particular image representation or a specific visual domain. Our approach shows good performance on a number of difficult cross-domain visual tasks e.g., matching paintings or sketches to real photographs. The method also allows us to demonstrate novel applications such as Internet re-photography, and painting2gps. While at present the technique is too computationally intensive to be practical for interactive image retrieval, we hope that some of the ideas will eventually become applicable to that domain as well.},

Field tests were performed at a 160 MW coal-fired unit to investigate the relationships between process controllable variables, and optimization targets and constraints. Based on the test data, a modified on-line support vector regression model was proposed for characteristic function approximation, in which the model parameters can be continuously adapted for changes in coal quality and other conditions of plant equipment. The optimization scheme was implemented by a genetic algorithm in two stages. Firstly, the multi-objective combustion optimization problem was solved to achieve an optimal Pareto front, which contains optimal solutions for lowest unit heat rate and lowest NOx emissions. Secondly, best operating settings for the boiler, and SCR system and air preheater were obtained for lowest operating cost under the constraints of NOx emissions limit and air preheater ammonium bisulfate deposition depth.},

Moreover, by improving the reliability of the power system and, in the long term, lowering peak demand, DR reduces overall plant and capital cost investments and postpones the need for network upgrades.

  abstract =  {Raising consumers’ awareness of energy consumption is one of the first steps in encouraging the adoption of energy saving behaviours that result in energy efficiency. Green information systems are becoming recognised as a solution to many environmental problems although information technology (e.g. disposal of IT devices) has also been associated with causing detrimental effects on the environment. Researchers and practitioners have begun to focus on Green ICT but there is little scholarly research on the use of ICT tools such as social media from an energy efficiency context to raise consumer awareness and improve their engagement in tackling environmental issues. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the use of social media and existing tools for the interaction of people on energy saving discussions and for generating awareness and engagement (which thereby leads to energy efficiency behaviour). In this paper the authors provide a state of the art review around the concept of energy awareness, models of consumer engagement, and more importantly the use of social media in the energy efficiency context. This research is based on a desk-based normative review and seeks to provide a better understanding to both scholars and practitioners involved in the use of ICT for driving energy consumer awareness and engagement for energy efficiency.},

  abstract =     {This paper analyzes a ten-year long technology debate, which dealt with the so-called advanced electricity meters in Norway (1998–2008). The debate circled around one central question: should the implementation of this technology be forced through with regulations or should the market decide on pace and character of implementation? In 2008 it was decided that it was best to regulate the implementation. Throughout these 10 years, the debate largely concerned how the future would look with or without regulation. This paper is inspired by “the sociology of expectation”, which assumes that futures are performative. This means that when the future is evoked or imagined, it influences present action and navigation. With this in mind, the paper analyzes future visions and expectations as they were formulated in the technology debate, and traces the role of these futures in the policy debate and for the policy outcome. The paper identifies two modes of future performativity: translative and transformative futures. Translative futures are often mobilized as spokespersons for desired technology or policy trajectories. Here, they work as (a) stagestting devices: sparking debate, enrolling new actors in the debate and generating interest. Further, they work as (b) regulative tools: establishing the need for political decisions, either to realize the content of future visions, or to avoid the contents of alternative futures. Transformative futures do more subtle and gradual work, shifting the practical, symbolic and cognitive meaning of “what” the technology in question might become in the future. As an example, the significance of the advanced electricity meters discussed in this paper changed from being a device filling the knowledge gaps of electricity consumers, to being a central hub in households delivering a range of potential services and being available for a number of different users. In this paper, I describe the gradual shift in understanding of what advanced electricity meters could be as a virtual domestication trajectory.},

We explore how users were imagined in the project, and how the idea of active user participation was shadowed by an ambivalent and paradoxical view of users as knowledge deficient and incompetent. The case illustrates how the boundaries between involving users and by-passing users becomes blurred. Through this, we contribute to the knowledge on how user imaginaries and future expectations influence research and innovation processes, illustrating how traditional models of knowledge deficiency can lead to minimal user engagement.},

Inspired by science and technology studies (STS), this article compares four smart grid demonstration projects that engage households in Norway, where much activity has been triggered by a mandatory roll-out of smart electricity meters by 2019. We ask how local actors across different sectors interpret the potential of smart electricity meters, and how different understandings lead to diverging innovation strategies. The result is four case studies illustrating how smart grid set-ups are constructed, and how new smart technologies are socialized into pre-existing localities or not. The four case studies highlight: (1) a constellation of healthcare and the electricity industry, resulting in a focus on simplicity and welfare. (2) A merger between the construction industry and the electricity industry, exploring how passive houses, PV-systems and smart technology influence collective practices. (3) How local authorities, research and industry interpreted smart grids differently, resulting in a focus on “greening”, grid optimization and user flexibility. (4) How organizational and disciplinary conflicts led to alienation from the smart grid concept, hindering socialization. This diversity within a small country suggests that smart grids should be treated as situated technology rather than a “catch-all” silver bullet.},

There is currently a discourse of very high ambitions and anticipation regarding how the implementation of a broad collection of smart grid related technologies across scales and geographies would influence the performance of electricity grids, and through this play an essential role in energy transition processes, renewable energy implementation, de-carbonization etc. So far, the question of how to achieve the desired goals has largely been a technical endeavor. In this special issue, and in this paper, we explore some of the ways through which social scientists have begun to engage the smart grid development. Here, research mainly targets three distinct areas of scientific research. First, emerging infrastructures attract a large number of imaginaries or visions, which can be studied. Second, smart grids have explicit expectations towards its users inscribed in them. The second group of contributions gathered here traces these types of inscriptions and the various relationships that might emerge between new technologies and publics at different scales. Third, infrastructures are large socio-technical systems that have to be built. Studies of this kind of system building and transformation are collected in the third part of this issue.},

Through our assessment of the landscape of relevant academic literature and interviews with experts within the fields of behavioral economics and environmental psychology, we identify five principles of behavioral economics that are most salient for this sector: awareness, learning, social norms, goal setting, and framing. These five principles are examined through six case studies of companies within the client’s peer group: OPOWER, Earth Aid, Microsoft Hohm, Google PowerMeter, Wattvision and GreenLite Dartmouth/TELLEMOTION. In each case study, particular attention is paid to how effectively the behavioral economic intervention is implemented and best practices are highlighted. The paper concludes with tailored recommendations for PlotWatt. Our research suggests that a few behavioral economic tweaks to the user interface and reporting systems could lead to unique, measurable and significant behavior change that not only saves money for the household but also, in some case, motivates a deeper interest in conservation and curtailment of energy consumption.},

Our multidisciplinary research is being undertaken in a set of nominally identical townhouses in Twin Rivers, New Jersey, a recently built community of standard construction with gas space heating, electric central air conditioning, and a full set of appliances.

Average levels of energy consumption and their dependence on weather and building type have been established, thereby permitting detailed quantitative studies of the sources of remaining variability. Starting from this baseline, we have established the level of change in energy consumption that followed the “energy crisis” in the autumn of 1973 and we have performed two kinds of controlled experiments: (1) experiments where a set of modifications (retrofits) are made to the building structure, and (2) experiments where “feedback” is provided to residents, on a regular basis, reporting their level of consumption of energy. Conclusions drawn from our modeling and experimentation are presented here, with emphasis given to those results bearing directly on the character of programs to retrofit the national housing stock.

Photographs of the site, of building defects, and of our retrofits are included, as well as a selection of graphical displays of data, each a snapshot of a kind of analysis we have found useful and are prepared to recommend to others who wish to help develop an understanding of how houses work.

Lists are included both of the program's reports and publications and of the people who have contributed to the Twin Rivers program since its inception.},

Guided by Matthies’ (2005) heuristic model of environmentally relevant behavior, the current study examined the effectiveness of providing appliance-specific (disaggregated) feedback on reducing residential electricity consumption. The primary hypothesis was that households that received this type of feedback would reduce their electricity consumption compared to those in a no-contact control group and those who received an energy-displaying device. A total of 70 households were recruited via mail survey from neighborhoods in Vista, California. After filling out and returning a mailed survey and signing a consent form, households were randomly assigned to receive disaggregated feedback through a website, receive an energy display, or to a no-contact control group. A follow-up survey was administered in order to test two hypotheses and to address a research question. Participants with an in-home display conserved the greatest amount of electricity compared to participants who received access to appliance specific feedback through a website and the no-contact control group. Findings are discussed in the context of the contribution of disaggregated feedback as an intervention strategy aimed at reducing household energy consumption.},

This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450–600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the “dust bowl” era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4–1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6–1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding ≈1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

patterns is the first step in reducing the electric cost for a house. Conventional electricity
consumption monitoring systems usually rely on specially designed power measuring
equipment such as a smart meter or sub-metering device. However, it is not easy to
obtain enough information for energy monitoring because the limited number of
measuring equipment can be installed due to their costs and privacy issues. Therefore,
the status of devices could be usually inferred from limited information using the
technology called non-intrusive appliance load monitoring. However, the limited
information causes inaccuracy in estimating operation status of the devices. Many efforts
have been performed to improve the estimation accuracy. Smart devices including smart
appliances have been deployed recently to provide more advanced services at home.
Network connectivity is one of the essential functions for the smart devices. When the
operation information of those smart devices can be shared with energy monitoring
devices, it can improve the energy consumption monitoring. In this paper, a hybrid
approach is proposed to improve energy consumption status estimation. Devices' status
information is shared via ubiquitous home networks in addition to the conventional
energy consumption monitoring. This approach makes the energy consumption inference
more simple and accurate for the rest of unknown devices.},

  abstract =     {Abstract Most commentators expect improved energy efficiency and reduced energy demand to provide the dominant contribution to tackling global climate change. But at the global level, the correlation between increased wealth and increased energy consumption is very strong and the impact of policies to reduce energy demand is both limited and contested. Different academic disciplines approach energy demand reduction in different ways: emphasising some mechanisms and neglecting others, being more or less optimistic about the potential for reducing energy demand and providing insights that are more or less useful for policymakers. This article provides an overview of the main issues and challenges associated with energy demand reduction, summarises how this challenge is ‘framed’ by key academic disciplines, indicates how these can provide complementary insights for policymakers and argues that a ‘sociotechnical’ perspective can provide a deeper understanding of the nature of this challenge and the processes through which it can be achieved. The article integrates ideas from the natural sciences, economics, psychology, innovation studies and sociology but does not give equal weight to each. It argues that reducing energy demand will prove more difficult than is commonly assumed and current approaches will be insufficient to deliver the transformation required.},

  abstract =    {With the advent of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) systems that are capable of twoway
communications between the utility grid and a building, the Automated Home Energy
Management (AHEM) industry has made a significant effort to develop capabilities that allow
residential building systems to respond to utility demand events by temporarily reducing their
electricity use. Major appliance manufacturers are following suit by developing Home Area
Network-tied appliance suites that can take signals from the home’s “smart meter,” a.k.a. AMI
meter, and adjust their run cycles accordingly. For example, during a peak event a refrigerator
could delay a defrost cycle for several hours, or the clothes dryer may run at a lower heat setting
so that the power requirement is much lower but clothes take longer to dry. Household
appliances can use numerous strategies to respond to demand-side management (DSM)
opportunities, which could substantially reduce electricity bills for the residents, depending on
the pricing structures used by the utilities to incent these types of responses. However, these
systems and infrastructures are very new, and have not been broadly tested in real-world
scenarios.
Homeowners and utilities have strong incentives to facilitate efficient DSM. Electricity prices
and supply reliability are important to residential customers, and are closely tied to the
operational practices of the electric utility and how it handles peak demand issues. The service
providers are most likely primarily concerned with meeting the requirements of public utility
commissions (and earnings if investor-owned), but dissatisfied ratepayers pose business and
regulatory risks. Grid-connected appliances can help all parties by automatically shifting energy
use out of peak hours to level loads and maintaining ratepayer satisfaction with their utilities
through supply reliability and cash incentives (National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency,
2010). The first step to quantifying these end effects is to test these systems and their responses
in simulated demand-response (DR) conditions while monitoring energy use and overall system
performance.},

In this approach, NNs are trained to extract important features from the input current waveform to uniquely identify various types of devices using their distinct harmonic "signatures". Such automated, noninvasive device identification will be critical in future power-quality monitoring and enhancement systems. Several NN-based classification models including multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) network, and support vector machines (SVM) with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels were developed for signature extraction and device identification. These models were trained and tested using spike train data gathered from the Fourier analysis of the input current waveform in the presence of multiple devices. The performance of these models was compared in terms of their accuracy, generalization ability, and noise tolerance limits. The results showed that MLPs and SVM were both able to determine the presence of devices based on their harmonic signatures with high accuracy. MLP was found to be the best signature identification method because of its low computational requirements and ability to extract the information necessary for highly accurate device identification.},

However, in a large scale deployment, the digital meter is unlikely to have multiple electrical parameters which most existing NILM research rely on. In this paper, we report the results of using a Bayesian approach to obtain the disaggregation of the loads where only active power measurements are available at a sampling rate of a few seconds. The proposed method requires the prior availability of appliance information (i.e., the prior probability and appliance ratings). To obtain the appliance information for the disaggregation algorithm, we adopt an unsupervised learning approach. Further, we present the results of these algorithms on a simulated and an open household electric consumption data set.},

HEM involves appropriate management of home appliance usage through deliberate efforts from the end-user.

The installation of smart meter has led to a number of analytics and applications developed on top of its data. However, the algorithms are evaluated over a very small subset of experimental or open dataset. To mitigate this problem, a bottom-up data generation approach is proposed in this paper. The appliances are considered as combination of fundamental electrical components. The appliance characteristics and operations are modeled through stochastic parameters, which are available as prior information or through learning from existing meter data. Preliminary results of generating data for the application of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring is presented.},

Daily routines such as cooking, doing laundry, and Computing. Smart energy meter data can be used

Activities are therefore a lens through which energy feedback to households can be made salient and
understandable. This paper demonstrates how hourly time profiles of household activities can be
inferred from smart energy meter data, supplemented by appliance monitors and environmental
sensors. In-depth interviews and home surveys are used to identify appliances and devices used for a
range of activities. These relationships between technologies and activities are captured in an ‘activity
ontology’ that can be applied to smart meter data to make inferences on hourly time profiles of up to
nine everyday activities. Results are presented from six homes participating in a UK trial of smart
home technologies. The duration of activities and when they are carried out is examined within
households. The time profile of domestic activities has routine characteristics but these tend to vary
widely between households with different socio-demographic characteristics. Analysing the energy
consumption associated with different activities leads to a useful means of providing activity-itemised
energy feedback, and also reveals certain households to be high energy-using across a range of
activities.},

Strategies for behaviour change will be more effective if they target the most important causes of the behaviour in question. Therefore, this paper first discusses the factors influencing household energy use. Three barriers to fossil fuel energy conservation are discussed: insufficient knowledge of effective ways to reduce household energy use, the low priority and high costs of energy savings, and the lack of feasible alternatives. Next, the paper elaborates on the effectiveness and acceptability of strategies aimed to promote household energy savings. Informational strategies aimed at changing individuals’ knowledge, perceptions, cognitions, motivations and norms, as well as structural strategies aimed at changing the context in which decisions are made, are discussed. This paper focuses on the psychological literature on household energy conservation, which mostly examined the effects of informational strategies.

Trends in the phase and the amplitude of the annual cycle have been observed, but the causes and significance of these changes remain poorly understood—in part because we lack an understanding of the natural variability. Here we show that the phase of the annual cycle of surface temperature over extratropical land shifted towards earlier seasons by 1.7 days between 1954 and 2007; this change is highly anomalous with respect to earlier variations, which we interpret as being indicative of the natural range. Significant changes in the amplitude of the annual cycle are also observed between 1954 and 2007. These shifts in the annual cycles appear to be related, in part, to changes in the northern annular mode of climate variability, although the land phase shift is significantly larger than that predicted by trends in the northern annular mode alone. Few of the climate models presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reproduce the observed decrease in amplitude and none reproduce the shift towards earlier seasons.},

In this paper an attempt is made to review the various energy demand forecasting models. Traditional methods such as time series, regression, econometric, ARIMA as well as soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, and neural networks are being extensively used for demand side management.

Sugihara presents a computational mechanism that functionally mimics human perception in being able to generate three-dimensional descriptions of objects from two-dimensional line drawings. The objects considered are polyhedrons or solid objects bounded by planar faces, and the line drawings are single-view pictures of these objects.

Sugihara's mechanism has several potential applications. It can facilitate man-machine communication by extracting object structures automatically from pictures drawn by a designer, which can be particularly useful in the computer-aided design of geometric objects, such as mechanical parts and buildings. It can also be used in the intermediate stage of computer vision systems used to obtain and analyze images in the outside world. The computational mechanism itself is not accompanied by a large database but is composed of several simple procedures based on linear algebra and combinatorial theory.

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring is a problem to identify the operating conditions of the electric appliances in a house only by observing the overall load current and voltage. Since the overall load current is expressed as a superposition of each current of the operating appliance, the monitoring problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic programming problem by expressing the operating conditions as integer variables. This problem is solvable with sufficiently small computational burden thanks to the recent development of the commercial software. The proposed method does not require the relearning even when a new appliance is installed in the house. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is applicable to cases that some appliance has multiple modes, and cases that some same-type appliances operate simultaneously. Usefulness of the proposed technique is verified through some experimental results.},

  abstract =     {There is a growing interest in reducing energy consumption and the associated greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy. The residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies suitable for residential applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method. Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different applicability. A critical review of each technique, focusing on the strengths, shortcomings and purposes, is provided along with a review of models reported in the literature.},

We use the RNN-SPN to classify digits in cluttered MNIST sequences. The proposed model achieves a single digit error of 1.5% compared to 2.9% for a convolutional networks and 2.0% for convolutional networks with SPN layers. The SPN outputs a zoomed, rotated and skewed version of the input image. We investigate different down-sampling factors (ratio of pixel in input and output) for the SPN and show that the RNN-SPN model is able to down-sample the input images without deteriorating performance. The down-sampling in RNN-SPN can be thought of as adaptive down-sampling that minimizes the information loss in the regions of interest. We attribute the superior performance of the RNN-SPN to the fact that it can attend to a sequence of regions of interest.},

Realizing that current energy disaggregation approaches are hard to perform for the ordinary consumers and free and open applications/services are not generally available, we provide a consumer-oriented web service, Smart Saver, which is not only open and free to the consumers but also user-friendly and easy-to-use for energy disaggregation. Based on a simple power model, a sparse switching event recovery model is established as the core of Smart Saver. By feeding the basic power information of appliances into Smart Saver, the users will be provided with 1) online energy disaggregation and appliance monitoring if they have smart meters communicating with our service, or 2) offline energy disaggregation if they upload their aggregated power data.},

To overcome the problems, this paper utilizes easily accessible knowledge of appliances and the sparsity of the switching events to design a Sparse Switching Event Recovering (SSER) method. Furthermore, a robust version of this method (RSSER) is developed to tackle the problems caused by corrupted data and unknown appliances. By minimizing the total variation of the sparse event matrix and introducing a virtual appliance, \{RSSER\} can obtain accurate energy disaggregation results in the presence of outliers, without using any explicit data cleansing method. To speed up RSSER, a Parallel Local Optimization Algorithm (PLOA) is proposed to solve the problem in active epochs of appliance activities in parallel. To automatically acquire the power consumption knowledge of appliances whose information is unknown, we develop a K-median clustering based power division approach and establish an appliance power configuration platform. Using real-world trace data from our energy monitoring platform, the performance of \{RSSER\} is compared with that of the state-of-the-art solutions, including the least square estimation methods and a machine learning method using iterative Hidden Markov Model. The results show that \{RSSER\} not only has an overall better performance in both detection accuracy and overhead, but also can tolerate the interference of corrupted data and unknown appliances.},

Sensor-based occupancy detection is usually costly and may suffer from high false positive rates. As such, occupancy detection using load curve data has been proposed. Such methods, however, normally (i) rely on tedious and nontrivial model training process and (ii) do not consider the influence of corrupted data in load curve. To overcome these pitfalls, we develop a practical, robust non-intrusive occupancy detection approach that does not require model training and data cleansing. Only using load curve data and readily available appliance knowledge, the method achieves occupancy detection by three main steps: (i) the appliances’ mode states are firstly decoded via a carefully designed robust sparse switching event recovering model; (ii) the human actions are recovered with a priori knowledge of human-activated switching events; (iii) the occupancy states are then inferred based on the recovered human actions along with empirical strategies and association rules. We evaluate our approach and compare it with existing methods with real-world data. The results show that our approach can achieve similar performance to those using supervised machine learning.},

It has become one of the most important assets for modern power systems. Many operational decisions are made based on the information discovered in the data. Load curve data, however, usually suffers from corruptions caused by various factors, such as data transmission errors or malfunctioning meters. To solve the problem, tremendous research efforts have been made on load curve data cleansing. Most existing approaches apply outlier detection methods from the supply side (i.e., electricity service providers), which may only have aggregated load data. In this paper, we propose to seek aid from the demand side (i.e., electricity service users). With the help of readily available knowledge on consumers' appliances, we present an appliance-driven approach to load curve data cleansing. This approach utilizes data generation rules and a Sequential Local Optimization Algorithm (SLOA) to solve the Corrupted Data Identification Problem (CDIP). We evaluate the performance of SLOA with real-world trace data and synthetic data. The results indicate that, comparing to existing load data cleansing methods, such as B-spline smoothing, our approach has an overall better performance and can effectively identify consecutive corrupted data. Experimental results also show that our method is robust in various tests.},

Computers are now used in most homes, almost every day and laptop ownership has overtaken traditional desktop computers. Mobile devices give access to services that in the past required desktops, and they are usually more energy efficient. Today's computers usually rely on wireless routers that are often run all day. The effect of these changes on electricity use in the home has been profound. At least 60% more electricity was used for UK home computing in 2012 than in 1990. The implications of recent changes in information technology use are assessed for domestic electricity use and carbon emissions, using data from the Household Electricity Survey (HES) – the most detailed survey of electricity consumption in UK homes. On average, routers use twice as much energy per day as the laptops they serve. Laptops also draw power at a different time of day compared with desktop computers – which has implications for generation. Policy and practical recommendations are made for reducing energy use for information technology, including the estimated energy savings that could be achieved if UK routers met the US Energy Star standard for energy efficiency.},

  abstract =    {The ICT sector has transformed the way we live,
work, learn and play. From mobile phones and
micro-computer chips to the internet, ICT has
consistently delivered innovative products and
services that are now an integral part of everyday
life. ICT has systematically increased productivity
and supported economic growth across both
developed and developing countries. But what
impact do pervasive information and
communication technologies have on global
warming? Is it a sector that will hinder or help
our fight against dangerous climate change?
To answer these questions, this report
has quantified the direct emissions from ICT
products and services based on expected
growth in the sector. It also looked at where ICT
could enable significant reductions of emissions
in other sectors of the economy and has quantified
these in terms of CO2e emission savings and
cost savings.
Aside from emissions associated with
deforestation, the largest contribution to
man-made GHG emissions comes from power
generation and fuel used for transportation.
It is therefore not surprising that the biggest role
ICTs could play is in helping to improve energy
efficiency in power transmission and distribution
(T&D), in buildings and factories that demand
power and in the use of transportation to
deliver goods.
In total, ICTs could deliver
approximately 7.8 GtCO2e of emissions savings
in 2020. This represents 15% of emissions in 2020
based on a BAU estimation. It represents a
significant proportion of the reductions below
1990 levels that scientists and economists
recommend by 2020 to avoid dangerous climate
change1 In economic terms, the ICT-enabled
energy efficiency translates into approximately
¤600 billion ($946.5 billion2
) of cost savings.3
It is an opportunity that cannot be overlooked.
Our analysis identifies some of the biggest and
most accessible opportunities for ICT to achieve
these savings.
•Smart motor systems: A review of
manufacturing in China has identified that
without optimisation, 10% of China’s emissions
(2% of global emissions) in 2020 will come from
China’s motor systems alone and to improve
industrial efficiency even by 10% would deliver
up to 200 million tonnes (Mt) CO2e savings.
Applied globally, optimised motors and
industrial automation would reduce 0.97 GtCO2e
in 2020, worth ¤68 billion ($107.2 billion).4
• Smart logistics: Through a host of efficiencies
in transport and storage, smart logistics in
Europe could deliver fuel, electricity and heating
savings of 225 MtCO2e. The global emissions
savings from smart logistics in 2020 would reach
1.52 GtCO2e, with energy savings worth
¤280 billion ($441.7 billion).
• Smart buildings: A closer look at buildings in
North America indicates that better building
design, management and automation could save
15% of North America’s buildings emissions.
Globally, smart buildings technologies would
enable 1.68 GtCO2e of emissions savings, worth
¤216 billion ($340.8 billion).
• Smart grids: Reducing T&D losses in India’s
power sector by 30% is possible through better
monitoring and management of electricity
grids, first with smart meters and then by
integrating more advanced ICTs into the
so-called energy internet. Smart grid
technologies were the largest opportunity
found in the study and could globally reduce
2.03 GtCO2e , worth ¤79 billion ($124.6 billion).},

  abstract =     {Many experts are concerned about the would-be character of smart grid users-specifically, that they will not engage with smart grid technologies out of disinterest or a lack of knowledge. This has been considered problematic because users are considered key to unlocking the full potential of the smart grid. This paper studied smart grid users from the Norwegian demo Steinkjer pilot and, through focus group interviews, collected articulations of everyday smart grid enactments. Eliciting little lack in knowledge or interest, users were able to articulate relevant smart grid enactments through a spectrum of skepticism, pragmatism and enthusiasm. Utilizing the concept of material publics [22], this paper argued that smart meters can bridge the green political economy of climate challenge issues with the user context of everyday energy consumption. The paper found evidence that user articulations, whether skeptical or enthusiastic, are rooted in political engagement as opposed to purely economic interest. This suggests a case for involving material publics in the smart grid and indicates that explanations for user disengagement can be found in active, subversive co-articulations among users rather than passive disinterest or a lack of knowledge. This paper suggests acknowledging smart grid users as politically engaged material publics.

Highlights
• We conducted focus groups with smart grid users.
• Users articulated a range of enactments from skepticism and pragmatism to enthusiasm.
• Strong political sentiment was found instead of disinterest or a lack of knowledge.
• Co-articulations of smart grid enactments by users can be subversive regarding smart grids.
• This poses a challenge that must be addressed in smart grid implementation scenarios.},

  abstract =     {This paper answers an important question consensually identified as crucial for smart grid roll-out. Our objective is to highlight the reasons for economic, technological and regulatory uncertainty continuing in the smart grid sector. The argument of this paper is that to face uncertainty, actors adopted strategic positioning but not systematically favoring the emergence of a structuring and shared vision of smart grid. However, converging visions are necessary to limit uncertainty and thus secure the sector’s development and durability in the coming years. The results presented here are based on two methodological approaches. First, a social network analysis of worldwide relationships between smart grid actors has been performed to characterize the actors’ positioning strategies. The paper identifies four categories of actors: local observers, global observers, experimenters, and central actors. Second, a qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with approximately 30 French smart grid stakeholders gave us information on discourses and perceptions of the sector's reality and constraints. It appeared that smart grid merges both long-established actors in the smart grid focal sector, i.e., energy, promoting a highly accurate but strictly energy-oriented perception, and new entrants coming from related sectors such as ICT, offering an open but indistinct perspective. Therefore, stakeholders diverge on the definition and potential source of added value. These results help to elucidate the transition of socio-technical systems. Indeed, at this very moment when contextual uncertainty remains high, it appears that actors from the focal sector play a crucial part in driving the current sector development, whereas new entrants remain unable to modify the sector’s regime decisively. One can interpret this situation as a sign of the failure of the smart grid sector to emerge as such. Conversely, one can see here an evolution of focal actors’ strategies regarding uncertainty in an innovative socio-technical system in transition. To solve this issue, further studies should be conducted both on the smart grid sector to see how it will evolve and on other sectors to search for similar trends.},

This data is particularly important for power system analysis.

Total energy consumption was reduced by 12 % after the installation of the system.

60 % of the houses recognized and reduced standby power consumption.

70 % of the houses paid attention to the energy consumption for space heating and they have taken actions such as switching to other appliances and reducing the length of space heating. Some of the houses were successful to cut down their heating demand by 20–45 %.},

Major findings were as follows: (1) installation of the system led to a 9% reduction in power consumption, (2) comparisons of daily-load curves and load-duration curves for each appliance, before and after installation, revealed various energy-saving behaviors of the household members such as the reduction of standby power and better control of appliance operation, and (3) energy-conservation awareness affected not only the power consumption of the appliances explicitly shown on the display monitor, but also other household appliances.},

  abstract =  {The authors have proposed a method of reducing the energy consumption in residential
buildings by providing household members with information on energy consumption in their
own houses. An on-line interactive “energy consumption information system” that displays
power consumption of up to 16 different appliance, and power consumption of the whole house
was installed in 9 homes. Moreover, a remodeled system that displays city gas consumption of
the whole house, and room temperature in addition to power consumption was constructed and
was installed in 10 additional homes. The intent was to motivate energy-saving activities and
raise energy-saving consciousness. The effects on energy consumption have been analyzed in
detail based on the monitored energy data before and after the installation of the system, which
have shown a reduction in household energy demands.
This paper describes the amount of energy savings actually achieved by setting up the
display system. It then proceeds to describe how these savings were achieved by the residents,
i.e., what kinds of energy saving activities were induced by looking into the visualized energy
consumption data. In addition, we look at how the comfort of the residents changed, i.e., how the
space heating periods and the room temperatures were different.},

Fine grained, high resolution smart meter energy consumption data contains sensitive house hold activity signature. In this paper, we propose a tool called `Sensitivity Inspector' that detects sensitivity in smart meter data and inculcates privacy awareness among smart meter users, presuming private events are related to anomalous or unusual activities. Specifically, we analyze the sensitive content of smart meter data through robust unsupervised statistical method considering user activity as a piece-wise, stationary, stochastic process with associated uncertainty. We show the efficacy of our scheme under relevant statistical and information theoretic measures.

  abstract =    {Abstract

The aim of the research presented in this thesis was to infer design-related insights and guidelines to improve the use and effectiveness of home energy management systems (HEMS). This was done through an empirical evaluation of the longitudinal effectiveness of these devices and an exploration of factors that influence their use and effectiveness. Three case studies executed with three different HEMS in households, a life cycle assessment (LCA) on those three HEMS, as well as a reflection on the challenges of both researching and implementing HEMS in existing housing gave a comprehensive picture of the opportunities and barriers for HEMS. The research revealed five typical use patterns that emerged amongst households. It also revealed average energy savings of 7.8%, which however decreased in the follow-up that was conducted, and factors that may influence the use and effectiveness of HEMS. Nonetheless, the LCA calculations divulged that the HEMS can achieve net energy savings when taking their embedded energy into account.

Problem statement

The goal of reducing the energy consumption of existing housing formed the basis for this research. There are many facets to this energy consumption, including the characteristics of the house, its appliances, and the behaviours of its inhabitants. Because of this complexity, addressing only one of these facets is not effective in substantially reducing the overall energy consumption of households. This called for an interdisciplinary approach, merging the domains of design for sustainability, sustainable housing transformation and environmental psychology. In this thesis, HEMS were chosen as the intervention to address the various elements that contribute to household energy consumption, thereby functioning as a pivot. By giving feedback and/or helping manage consumption they can assist households in changing their behaviour and help save energy. However, in analysing literature on HEMS, four critique points were encountered. Past research tends to be limited in the types of HEMS and energy sources studied. Furthermore, limited knowledge was available on the longitudinal effectiveness of HEMS, the large variances in achieved energy savings and use of HEMS, and factors influencing their use and effectiveness.

Conceptual framework

To address these critique points and explore the influence of the factors: user, HEMS, other people, other products, context, and time; a framework was proposed. It postulated the pivotal role of HEMS and visualized the interdependence of the different elements. This framework structured the findings of the research.

Case studies

Three case studies were conducted. The first case study with an electricity monitor revealed that the effectiveness of HEMS tends to decrease over time. The initial savings in electricity consumption of, on average, 7.8% after four months were not sustained over a period of 15 months. The participants were divided into three groups, who all had the same rate of fall-back. However, the group that had a daily habit after 15 months of checking the monitor, achieved the largest savings in comparison to the groups that did not have a daily habit after 15 months or that returned the monitor after four months. The second and third case study with a multifunctional HEMS and a energy management device revealed five distinctive use patterns: there was often one main user who varied strongly in their knowledge of, interest in, and affinity with energy and technique in general, resulting in different needs and desires concerning the HEMS. Additionally, the studies revealed that contextual factors, such as the structure of the home and its energy meters, can impede the use and implementation of HEMS.

Lifecycle assessment

The positive result of the LCA was that all three types of HEMS can theoretically achieve net energy savings (where einvested < esaved) over the course of five years in the six scenarios that were created. However, it can take up to 24 months to achieve net energy savings, depending on the scenario and type of HEMS. No HEMS achieve a positive return on investment within five years in all six scenarios.

Conclusions

This research found that the role of HEMS in reducing the energy consumption of households is constrained when not taking the factors into consideration that were distilled in the case studies. For one, human factors, such as the characteristics of the user and other household members and family dynamics, may influence the use and effectiveness. Furthermore, physical elements, such as the design of the HEMS (e.g., the type of feedback, the quality of the technique, its usability and applicability) the design and functioning of appliances and the dwelling played a role. Particularly, the interplay between people and these physical elements such as the match/mismatch or compatibility/incompatibility between HEMS, users, appliances and the dwelling were influential, in part due to the complexity of reducing energy consumption and users’ preferred type of reduction approach. Based on these factors, design guidelines where formulated for HEMS with the aim to achieve lasting energy savings and increase the usability of HEMS. Examples of these guidelines are: HEMS should not be developed as standalone interventions but should be incorporated as part of a broader, overarching change strategy; one size does not fit all; and careful trade-offs needs to be made with regard to the design of the HEMS, e.g., while a small display size is positive for the LCA, it could limit the potential to influence behaviour.

Relevance

The resulting knowledge of these studies can be employed to inspire the different domains merged within this thesis. For the HEMS industry: in striving to designing HEMS that are capable of influencing users, effective in reducing energy consumption, and easily usable and implementable in everyday life. For the building industry this research illustrated the benefit of considering the behaviour of inhabitants in achieving sustainable housing transformation. Furthermore, lessons were presented in how the building industry can contribute to increasing the ease of implementation of HEMS. HEMS researchers may assimilate knowledge for future research to deepen the knowledge on ways of increasing the effectiveness of HEMS.

HEMS increasingly receive attention for their role in energy conservation in households. A literature review and a case study examine the mid-term effectiveness (more than 4 months) of HEMS. The case study presents the results of a 15-month pilot with a domestic energy monitor in the Netherlands. It explores the extent to which participants manage to sustain their initial electricity savings over time, with a special focus on the development of habitual energy-saving behaviour. The results show that the initial savings in electricity consumption of 7.8\% after 4 months could not be sustained in the medium- to long-term. A second finding is that certain groups of people seem more receptive to energy-saving interventions than others. These participants quickly develop new habits and exhibit larger savings than other participants. Obviously, a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach for home energy monitors cannot be justified. For HEMS to be effective, a deeper understanding is needed that embraces social science, contextual factors, usability, and interaction design research.},

State transition probabilities are expressed conditional on how long the current state has been occupied. The conventional fixed-state transition probabilities aij are replaced by duration-dependent variables aij(d) that depend on the time d already spent in state i. In this way, state transition and state duration probabilities are combined to form duration-dependent transition probabilities. The transition probabilities are derived from the cumulative density function (CDF) of state duration. The training of \{HMMs\} with duration-dependent transitions are based on maximum likelihood segmentation of training data, using the Viterbi algorithm. At each training iteration, the current \{HMM\} parameters are used to segment every training example. All the segments associated with each state are then used to update state observation and transition parameters.

However, very little investigation has been carried out on the integration of household’ consumption trends, the parameters influencing them and the characteristics of the provided feedback. 2000 Swedish households were included in this study. Electricity consumption data for apartments and houses has been analyzed for a 4 year period as well as possible household socio-economic factors affecting it. The data has been further compared to other households located in different cities in Sweden. The effects of the different ways of presenting feedback used for the different households groups have also been evaluated. From the results obtained from the questionnaire used, several households’ characteristics were proposed together with consumers’ preferences to be considered during the development of feedback. Web based feedback resulted in being the most effective (when compared to display and bills), achieving electricity savings of approximately 15% within households that visited the web-site. The monthly income is amongst the most influential factors determining electricity consumption although only in high and low income groups.

Highlights

► Groups of households characteristics and electricity consumption trends compared. 
► Individual households variations larger than between groups. 
► Web based feedback reduced consumption with 15%. 
► Income influences consumption of high and low income groups. 
► Feedback should be based on specific household characteristics.},

In the proposal, the main elements of the studied models are grouped and the new model is combined with external variables, which influence the implementation of the management system, to give the end-user its proper role as an active part of the electricity value chain, as a strategy to contribute with home energy efficiency providing new demand patterns.},

Frustrated by a sense of global mispriorities, I blurted out some snarky and mildly regrettable tweets on the lack of attention to climate change in the tech industry (Twitter being a sublime medium for the snarky and regrettable). Climate change is the problem of our time, it’s everyone’s problem, and most of our problem-solvers are assuming that someone else will solve it.

I’m grateful to one problem-solver, who wrote to ask for specifics —

“How do you think the tech community (startup community, or any community) can contribute to tech and/or policy solutions on a global scale?”

The notes below are my attempt to answer that question.

This is a “personal view”, biased by my experiences and idiosyncrasies. I’ve followed the climate situation for some time, including working on Al Gore’s book Our Choice, but I can’t hope to convey the full picture — just a sliver that’s visible from where I’m standing. I urge you to talk to many scientists and engineers involved in climate analysis and energy, and see for yourself what the needs are and how you can contribute.

This is aimed at people in the tech industry, and is more about what you can do with your career than at a hackathon. I’m not going to discuss policy and regulation, although they’re no less important than technological innovation. A good way to think about it, via Saul Griffith, is that it’s the role of technologists to create options for policy-makers.

I’m also only going to directly discuss technology related to the primary cause of climate change (the burning of fossil fuels), although there are technological needs related to other causes (livestock, deforestation, global poverty), as well as mitigating symptoms of climate change (droughts and storms, ecosystem damage, mass migrations).

Thus, designers must be concerned with both optimizing and estimating the energy consumption of circuits, architectures, and software. Most of the research in energy optimization and/or estimation has focused on single components of the system and has not looked across the interacting spectrum of the hardware and software. The novelty of our new energy estimation framework, SimplePower, is that it evaluates the energy considering the system as a whole rather than just as a sum of parts, and that it concurrently supports both compiler and architectural experimentation.

We present the design and use of the SimplePower framework that includes a transition-sensitive, cycle-accurate datapath energy model that interfaces with analytical and transition sensitive energy models for the memory and bus subsystems, respectively. We analyzed the energy consumption of ten codes from the multidimensional array domain, a domain that is important for embedded video and signal processing systems, after applying different compiler and architectural optimizations. Our experiments demonstrate that early estimates from the SimplePower energy estimation framework can help identify the system energy hotspots and enable architects and compiler designers to focus their efforts on these areas.},

In this paper, we propose a framework for energy monitoring and management in the factory. This will allow decision support systems and enterprise services to take into consideration the energy used by each individual productive asset and related energy using processes, to facilitate both global and local energy optimization.

This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite.},

Application of multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods to the behavioral data enabled us to identify 29 discrete, statistically distinguishable, observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes. Mapping the neural lines to the behavior(s) they evoke provides a behavioral reference atlas for neuron subsets covering a large fraction of larval neurons. This atlas is a starting point for connectivity- and activity-mapping studies to further investigate the mechanisms by which neurons mediate diverse behaviors.},

  abstract =  {Modelling power systems is an area of ongoing interest in the transmission management and control systems community. Continuing development is driven by two forces. The traditional tasks of model maintenance and management must be achieved with fewer resources. At the same time, model exchange and coordination has become a priority. The latter force arises from the disaggregation of utility functions and the introduction of power markets. This paper begins by identifying some of the power system modelling tasks that have become important, but are ill served by current tools and techniques. Among these are model versioning and version control, migration of models between, different schema, the transformation of models for different purposes or applications, and the merging of models from different sources. These tasks are typically handled by semi-manual methods or heavily customized software. The paper then describes the application of knowledge representation to power system modelling. In particular, the power of this approach to provide generic solutions to the, foregoing problems is explored. Knowledge representation is contrasted with more common data representations and put into context with current industry initiatives, EPRI CIM (common information model), UMS DAF (data access facility) and XML/CIM. Finally, the feasibility of using knowledge representation for power system models is illustrated with a case study from a major Australian distribution utility},

To this end, we propose Sparse Coding with Featured Discriminative Dictionary (SCFDD) by incorporating inherent shape and activation features to capture the discriminative characteristics of devices.

This paper presents several disaggregation techniques, and analyzes their advantages and disadvantages.},

A broad definition of DSM is proposed to include current policy objectives for emissions reduction, energy security and affordability, and encompasses energy efficiency, demand response, and on-site back-up generation and storage. The paper reviews the concept of DSM, outlines the historical impacts of DSM globally since the energy crises of the 1970s, analyses UK DSM policy, and examines the influence of EU Directives on UK DSM policy, as the country is currently deciding on how to include the demand-side in its Electricity Market Reform proposals and wider energy policy. Much of the focus of previous research has been on DSM technological trials and modelling studies rather than DSM policy and the paper contributes to filling this gap. Policy recommendations for the UK context are discussed, and it is clear that the success of DSM policies is determined primarily by regulatory support and utility financial incentives. It is important that policy clarity is provided and that current and new policies do not overlap.

• Critique of the different definitions of DSM.
• Review of global experiences with DSM policies.
• Review of UK DSM policies and the influence of the EU.

Several recent research efforts have sought to address the challenge of data access and building control. However, while these systems have made progress in specific areas, many unanswered questions still revolve around data management and what exactly it means to develop building applications. Critically, how would such a solution work in a real building setting and how can applications be written such that they can be re-used in other settings?

Through two pilot projects, in-home displays were installed in 33 Norwegian homes, and we provide a qualitative analysis of the effects. The results point to the potential differences in the ways households interact with the in-home displays. The effects differed among various groups according to people’s previous experiences with monitoring and their level of affluence. In the sample, affluent respondents living in detached houses tended to be accustomed to monitoring consumption before the display was introduced. These families used the display for controlling that “nothing was wrong”, but they did not use the information provided by the display to initiate new energy saving measures. In contrast, among less affluent flat owners the notion of “control” was specifically linked to the family’s management of finances, and in this sense the displays empowered them. In addition, the results indicate that the in-home display for this group resulted in electricity savings. The study adds to earlier research on the effects of in-home displays by showing the importance of previous experience with monitoring electricity for the effects of feedback and by highlighting not only energy savings but also social effects of displays.},

  abstract =    {There is a need for flexible, inexpensive metering technologies that can be deployed in many different monitoring scenarios. Individual loads may be expected to compute information about their power consumption. Utility providers, facilities managers, and other consumers will likely find innumerable ways to mine information if made available in a useful form. However, appropriate sensing and information delivery systems remain a chief bottleneck for many applications, and metering hardware and access to metered information will likely limit the implementation of new electric energy conservation strategies in the near future. This thesis presents solutions for two long standing problems in nonintrusive power and diagnostic monitoring. First, a high-resolution, physically windowed sensor architecture that is well-suited for energy score-keeping and diagnostic applications will be discussed. The sensor can track a large-scale main signal while capturing small-scale variations. The prototype system uses digital techniques to reconstruct an observed current with a high effective bit resolution. The sensor measures a small current signal using a closed-loop Hall sensor. and extends the range by driving a compensation current with a high performance current source through an auxiliary winding. The system combines the compensation command and the sampled output of the residual sensor to reconstruct the input signal with high bit resolution and bandwidth. Second, a long-standing problem in nonintrusive power monitoring involves the tracking of power consumption in the in the presence of loads with a continuously variable power demand. Two new techniques have been developed for automatically disaggregating, in real-time. different classes of continuously variable power electronic loads which draw distorted line currents. Experimental results of the proposed power estimator extracting the power consumption of common variable power loads such as a variable speed drive, a computer, and a light dimmer are presented.},

  abstract =    {With an ever growing population, global energy demand is predicted to keep increasing. Furthermore, the integration of renewable energy sources into the electricity grid (to reduce carbon emission and humanity's dependency on fossil fuels), complicates efforts to balance supply and demand, since their generation is intermittent and unpredictable. Traditionally, it has always been the supply side that has adapted to follow energy demand, however, in order to have a sustainable energy system for the future, the demand side will have to be better managed to match the available energy supply. In the first part of this thesis, we focus on understanding customers' energy consumption behavior (demand analytics). While previously, information about customer's energy consumption could be obtained only with coarse granularity (e.g., monthly or bimonthly), nowadays, using advanced metering infrastructure (or smart meters), utility companies are able to retrieve it in near real-time. By leveraging smart meter data, we then develop a versatile customer segmentation framework, track cluster changes over time, and identify key characteristics that define a cluster. Additionally, although household-level consumption is hard to predict, it can be used to improve aggregate-level forecasting by first segmenting the households into several clusters, forecasting the energy consumption of each cluster, and then aggregating those forecasts. The improvements provided by this strategy depend not only on the number of clusters, but also on the size of the customer base. Furthermore, we develop an approach to model the uncertainty of future demand. In contrast to previous work that used computationally expensive methods, such as simulation, bootstrapping, or ensemble, we construct prediction intervals directly using the time-varying conditional mean and variance of future demand. While analytics on customer energy data are indeed essential to understanding customer behavior, they could also lead to breaches of privacy, with all the attendant risks. The first part of this thesis closes by exploring symbolic representations of smart meter data which still allow learning algorithms to be performed on top of them, thus providing a trade-off between accurate analytics and the protection of customer privacy. In the second part of this thesis, we focus on mechanisms for incentivizing changes in customers' energy usage in order to maintain (electricity) grid stability, i.e., Demand Response (DR). We complement previous work in this area (which typically targeted large, industrial customers) by studying the application of DR to residential customers. We first study the influence of DR baselines, i.e., estimates of what customers would have consumed in the absence of a DR event. While the literature to date has focused on baseline accuracy and bias, we go beyond these concepts by explaining how a baseline affects customer participation in a DR event, and how it affects both the customer and company profit. We then discuss a strategy for matching the demand side with the supply side by using a multiunit auction performed by intelligent agents on behalf of customers. The thesis closes by eliciting behavioral incentives from the crowd of customers for promoting and maintaining customer engagement in DR programs.},

Historical feedback, which shows how much the recipient consumes in every billing period of the current and previous years, is now incorporated in graphic format on all residential bills. Two other types of consumption feedback have recently been tested with positive results. One is normative feedback, which provides households with information on how much energy it uses in relation to other households of similar type and size. The other is desegregation of end use into categories such as heat, light, kitchen appliances, etc., based on questionnaire and consumption data. These efforts are important for two reasons, one to make households aware of their energy use and thereby provide a better platform for energy savings, the other to improve communications between the energy utility and the energy customer. The latter is particulary important in Norway's completely open competitive electricity market where every customer can freely choose its supplier. In order to avoid migration of customers, positive consumer relations and good communication are essential characteristics of a successful utility. These developments in billing information in Stavanger Energi should be of interest for a wide audience, as information-poor bills are still the norm in much of Europe.},

  abstract =  {There is no limit to the promises made about ‘smart’ appliances, but what has been delivered so far is
disappointing. While the web, smart phones and screens have gone from strength to strength, we
have had not much more than the ‘internet refrigerator’ (launched four times, failed commercially
twice). There is confusion (among manufacturers as well as consumers) between the information
which enables smartness and the appliance which delivers the actual energy service. The appliances
themselves deliver services in much the same way as they always have because the basic physical
needs for heat, cold, light and power have not changed. but smartness provides ways of optimizing
the delivery of these services.
“Smartness” offers way to optimise delivery of these service, provide that smart appliances can
straddle the old world of power grids, wires, cautious engineering and standards, and the new
wireless world of internet, data and rapid innovation. That gap has not yet been bridged.
This paper identifies the main problems holding back the market for appliances, which increase
human welfare and optimise energy and resource consumption in an intelligent way. The great
historical success of household appliances has been their ability to simplify complicated tasks (e.g.
wash and dry clothes in one continuous operation) and elaborate what was formerly limited (e.g. the
vast range of specialised heat and power applications in the average kitchen). The current directions
of appliance ‘smartness’ – too often trying to achieve relatively simple objectives in unnecessarily
complicated ways – runs counter to this historical trend.
The paper review the types of services that manufacturers are presently offering in the products they
call smart. It concludes that most are of marginal value to the individual consumer, to society as a
whole and to the environment, and carry new risks which are often unrecognised. It proposes criteria
for assessing ‘useful smartness’ (or ‘intelligence’) in appliances and proposes strategies for how this
might be attained.},

Change-points often represent important events in the underlying processes, like a change in brain state reflected in EEG data or a change in the value of a company reflected in its stock price. However, change-points can be difficult to identify in noisy data streams. Previous attempts to identify change-points online using Bayesian inference relied on specifying in advance the rate at which they occur, called the hazard rate (h). This approach leads to predictions that can depend strongly on the choice of h and is unable to deal optimally with systems in which h is not constant in time. In this letter, we overcome these limitations by developing a hierarchical extension to earlier models. This approach allows h itself to be inferred from the data, which in turn helps to identify when change-points occur. We show that our approach can effectively identify change-points in both toy and real data sets with complex hazard rates and how it can be used as an ideal-observer model for human and animal behavior when faced with rapidly changing inputs.},

  abstract =     {This paper reviews the concepts, methods, and procedures that psychologists and other social scientists have used to develop and field test solutions to a range of social and behavioral problems. Despite only minimal interest at this time by the federal government in behavioral approaches to energy conservation, there are now many reports demonstrating the application of psychologically based procedures to conserve energy in buildings. Methods that reward energy conservation in a number of ways have yielded meaningful short-run reductions. Extensions of current strategies and other procedures derived from a framework presented in the paper may eventually result in more pervasive, longer-term savings. In the light of that objective, the paper also outlines a number of micro- and macro-level projects, some involving the meshing of behavioral and physical technology, that can be readily conducted in residential and commercial buildings.},

  abstract =  {A complete overview of distant automatic speech recognition
The performance of conventional Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems degrades dramatically as soon as the microphone is moved away from the mouth of the speaker. This is due to a broad variety of effects such as background noise, overlapping speech from other speakers, and reverberation. While traditional ASR systems underperform for speech captured with far–field sensors, there are a number of novel techniques within the recognition system as well as techniques developed in other areas of signal processing that can mitigate the deleterious effects of noise and reverberation, as well as separating speech from overlapping speakers.

Distant Speech Recognitionpresents a contemporary and comprehensive description of both theoretic abstraction and practical issues inherent in the distant ASR problem.

Key Features:

Covers the entire topic of distant ASR and offers practical solutions to overcome the problems related to it

However, it is difficult to quantify the effectiveness of energy conservation efforts in residential settings without any sort of end-use energy information as feedback. In order to achieve that, load monitoring methods are normally used. In recent years, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) approaches are gaining popularity due to their minimal installation requirements and cost effectiveness. For a NILM system to work, only one sensor at the entry point to a home is required. Fluctuations in the aggregate power consumption signals are used to mathematically estimate the composition of operation of appliances. This approach eliminates the requirement of installing plug-meters for every appliance in the house. In this paper, we provide a review of recent research efforts on state-of-the-art NILM algorithms before concluding with a baseline and overall vision for our future research direction.},

Previous studies have not focused on individual appliances, but this paper presents the findings of a UK field study involving 44 households which considered domestic cooking: it compares the effectiveness of providing paper-based energy-use/saving information with electronic feedback of energy-consumption via ECIs designed specifically for this investigation. Twelve Control Group households were monitored for a period of at least 12 months and this revealed an average daily consumption for electric cooking of 1.30 kWh. Subsequently across a minimum monitoring period of 2 months, 14 out of 31 households achieved energy savings of greater than 10% and six of these achieved savings of greater than 20%. The average reduction for households employing an ECI was 15%, whereas those given antecedent information alone reduced their electricity consumption, on average, by only 3%. The associated behavioural changes and the importance of providing regular feedback during use are identified. It is recommended that further attention be given to optimising the design and assessing the use of energy-consumption indicators in the home, in order to maximise the associated energy-saving potential.},

Two novel hybrid dynamic approaches, which are based on the SMN (single multiplicative neuron) model and the iterated nonlinear filters, have been proposed for forecasting energy consumption with small dataset and nonlinearity in our study. The forecasting models are established by using the weights and the biases of SMN model to present the state vector and the output of SMN model to present the observation equation, and the input vector to the SMN model is composed of the known energy consumption values with a rolling mechanism. The SMN model has advantages of better approximation capabilities, simpler network structures and faster learning algorithms. The nonlinear filters can deal with additive noises and can update model parameters when a new observation data arrives due to their iterative algorithm structure. Two case studies of energy consumption have been used to demonstrate the reliability of the proposed models, and the experimental results have indicated that the proposed approaches outperform existing models in forecasting energy consumption.},

Our analysis of these expert views indicates broad consensus of the necessity for smarter grids, particularly for economic and environmental reasons; yet stakeholders also associated a range of risks and barriers such as lack of investment, disengaged consumers, complexity and data privacy with measures to make the grid smarter. Different methods for implementing smarter grid functions were considered, all thought to be more likely in urban settings. Implications for policy and future research are considered.

  abstract =    {Enhancing the energy performance of buildings is recognized as one of the most promising methods to reduce the overall energy consumption. Before any building energy saving measure is taken, an energy performance assessment and diagnosis process should be conducted to identify the poor performance areas, the amount of abnormal energy use, and the probable causes behind. Many research and industrial efforts are found in the development and application of the building energy performance assessment and/or diagnosis methods. However, most the energy performance assessment methods often address the overall performance at the building level (e.g., the whole-building benchmarking tools) and most energy performance diagnosis methods often focus on the faults at the component level only (e.g., the FDD (fault detection and diagnosis) methods for chiller, AHU and VAV). Few methods can integrate the performance assessment and the performance diagnosis together and can be applied at different levels (i.e., from the building level to system level and subsystem/component level). A more critical issue is that most existing energy performance assessment and energy performance diagnosis methods/tools are based on the abundant energy performance data from the BAS (building automation system) and/or BMS (building management system) or based on the data from long-term in-situ measurement and conducted manually by well-trained experts. Few methods can be used in information-poor buildings wherein very limited energy and building data are available. This thesis presents a comprehensive energy performance assessment and diagnosis method for enhancing the energy performance of information poor buildings. This method can examine the energy performance at three levels, i.e., from the building level to the system level and the subsystem/component level. The core part of this comprehensive method is the energy performance calculation method which can estimate the energy performance data at different levels using limited energy use data (e.g., the monthly building electricity bill) and few in-situ measurement data of the HVAC system. The estimated performance data mainly include the total energy consumption of the whole building, the individual consumptions of three systems (i.e., HVAC system, "internal-consumers" and "other-consumers"), the building cooling load, and the energy efficiency of the HVAC system and main components. By comparing these estimated performance data with the benchmark data, the energy performance at different level can be assessed and the specific locations of the poor performance can be identified. The principle of the proposed energy performance calculation method is based on two basic energy balance principles, i.e., the electricity consumption balance at the building level and the indicative cooling energy balance between the demand side and the supply side of the HVAC system. These two balances quantitatively describe the most important energy conversion flows between the different but interactive systems in a building. By combing and solving all balance related equations, the energy consumptions of three systems (i.e., HVAC system, "internal-consumers" and "other-consumers") and the performance indicators (i.e., cooling load and energy efficiency) of the HVAC system can be calculated on monthly basis. To avoid the convergence problems and improve the computation efficiency in practice, an error-tolerant optimization algorithm using the trial-and-error method is developed.
To establish the indicative cooling energy balance of the HVAC system, the building cooling load contributed by various heat gains and the cooling energy supplied by the HVAC system need to be determined. A simplified cooling load calculation method is developed to estimate the monthly cumulated building cooling load. This method is based on the assumption that the total cooling load is equal to the sum of all individual heat gains in the building when the interacting effect of heat gains is ignored. This method, particularly the assumption of ignoring the interacting effect is evaluated by the detailed theoretic assessment and by the case-study analysis using the detailed simulation program. This simplified cooling load calculation method is also validated using the data from two real buildings. To determine the amount of the cooling energy supplied by the HVAC system and examine the energy performance of the HVAC system, two types of HVAC models (i.e., the system-level and component-level models) are developed/selected in this thesis. Using the system-level models, the building performance can be examined at system level by viewing the HVAC system as a whole. Using the component-level models, the building performance can be examined at the component level because the energy consumptions and energy efficiencies of both the HVAC system and main components are calculated using the individual components models (e.g., chiller, pump and fan models). The validation of the developed energy performance calculation method is carried out on two existing buildings in different climates (i.e., a building in Hong Kong and a building in Beijing). The validation results shown that the method can estimate the energy consumptions of three individual systems (i.e., HVAC system, "internal-consumers" and "other-consumers"), and the building cooling load and the energy efficiency of HVAC systems with a satisfactory accuracy in the mechanical cooling period. Although the results in some individual months with free cooling in the building in Beijing are relative poor, the overall results in the whole cooling period are acceptable. Two approaches using different performance benchmarks are presented for assessing the energy performance at different level and identifying the locations of poor energy performance and the causes. One approach is to use performance data from the similar buildings (i.e., generic benchmarks) for benchmarking. If the performance of an assessed building (or a system/component) is lower than the generic benchmark, the building (or system/component) is identified having energy problems. The other diagnostic approach is to use the performance data from the self-reference models (i.e., self-reference benchmarks) for benchmarking. A case study that illustrates how to combine these two approaches for assessing the energy performance and diagnosing the faults of a real building is presented in this thesis as well.},

  abstract =     {This paper presents a simplified energy performance assessment method for existing buildings in cooling season, which is based on energy bill disaggregation and energy performance analysis. This method requests very limited building energy data and can effectively assess the energy performance at building and system levels, and disaggregate the whole-building consumption into consumptions of three groups of end-uses. This method is based on two basic energy balance principles, i.e., the electricity consumption balances at building level and the cooling energy balances between demand side and supply side of HVAC systems. An optimization algorithm is developed to establish best possible cooling energy balances by minimizing the balance residuals and therefore to disaggregate the energy consumption of different users. The performance of the proposed method was validated in two existing buildings in Hong Kong and Beijing. The results, including the disaggregated energy consumptions and the key energy performance indicators of HVAC system, agreed well with the “measured” data in mechanical cooling months.},

The two methods are the goodness-of-fit (GOF) and the expert heuristic. Publicly available energy consumption data set is used in this study. As a metric of comparison, the total power change of the false positives and false negatives are utilized. The result shows that the GOF method performs better than the expert heuristic method. Variable parameters such as the number of data points can be fine-tuned to obtain an optimized GOF event detector. For the expert heuristic method, the variable parameters used to optimize the detector are the window size and the threshold value. The effect of varying the parameters on the performance of the event detection methods is discussed.},

Load recognition for identifying loads being connected and disconnected is applied to a NILM by using a neural network, especially for industrial electrical loads, even though some loads are activated at the nearly same time. In order to accurately decompose the aggregate load into its components, a feature-based model for describing the signatures of individual appliances and load combinations is used. The model will suggest the certain signatures which can be detected for all loads in order to indicate the activities of the separate components. To verify the performance of the model for the features selection, the data sets of the electrical loads and the load recognition techniques apply an electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and a neural network, respectively. The effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition are analyzed and compared by using the back propagation classifier and the learning vector quantization classifier. To obtain a maximum recognition accuracy rate, the calculation of the turn-on transient energy signature employs a window of samples, At, to adaptively segment a transient representative of a class of loads. Experiments performed with a variety of model data sets which reveal the back propagation classifier is superior to the learning quantization classifier in the effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition.},

Combined with non-intrusive load monitors, smart meter data can reveal precise home appliance usage information. An emerging solution to behavior leakage in smart meter measurement data is the use of battery-based load hiding. In this approach, a battery is used to store and supply power to home devices at strategic times to hide appliance loads from smart meters. A few such battery control algorithms have already been studied in the literature, but none have been evaluated from an adversarial point of view. In this paper, we first consider two well known battery privacy algorithms, Best Effort (BE) and Non-Intrusive Load Leveling (NILL), and demonstrate attacks that recover precise load change information, which can be used to recover appliance behavior information, under both algorithms. We then introduce a stepping approach to battery privacy algorithms that fundamentally differs from previous approaches by maximizing the error between the load demanded by a home and the external load seen by a smart meter. By design, precise load change recovery attacks are impossible. We also propose mutual-information based measurements to evaluate the privacy of different algorithms. We implement and evaluate four novel algorithms using the stepping approach, and show that under the mutual-information metrics they outperform BE and NILL.},

  abstract =  {Smart Appliances will allow households to time-shift certain energy demands enabling better
matching of demand and supply as a key part of a smart grid. There is only limited evidence that
quantifies this potential and previous studies have focused on a small number of appliance types and
only in peak periods. To address this research gap, this paper presents a modelling framework that
generates realistic electricity demand profiles for domestic appliance use that are based on measured
data. The aim is to use the model to provide insights into the amount of flexible demand that can be
available for shifting, when aggregated across a number of homes.
A bottom-up modelling approach is taken which is based on measurements of domestic appliances
such as switch-on times, operating time (duration), respective power consumption and frequency of
use. The method of the framework uses a probabilistic approach, where probabilistic functions
representing the likelihood of appliance usage are constructed and then used to generate high
temporal resolution, end-use specific household electricity demand profiles that represent random
variations between individual homes.
This paper shows the initial analysis of demand shifting of washing machines with automated
response as an example to quantify the potential of demand response for 100 households. The
results indicate that a mean power demand between 1 W to 15 W (from 50 W mean power peak
demand in the morning) is found available for shifting due to washing machines which provides a
useful contribution for demand-supply balancing strategies.},

The rebound effects are finally obtained from calculating the own- and cross-elasticities based on the prediction.

The respective average upper bound of direct rebound effects for them are 60.76%, 106.81%, 100.79%, and 33.61%, suggesting a possibility of backfire for the clothes washers and microwave ovens, while the respective upper bound of total rebound effects are 88.95%, 100.36%, 626.58%, and 31.61%.

We show that these representations become increasingly insensitive to small perturbations in the input with increasing network depth, which leads to better speech recognition performance with deeper networks. We also show that DNNs cannot extrapolate to test samples that are substantially different from the training examples. If the training data are sufficiently representative, however, internal features learned by the DNN are relatively stable with respect to speaker differences, bandwidth differences, and environment distortion. This enables DNN-based recognizers to perform as well or better than state-of-the-art systems based on GMMs or shallow networks without the need for explicit model adaptation or feature normalization.},

  abstract =        {Significant saving in energy consumption can be achieved by better energy management and control in residential buildings. More advanced control approaches require real-time information on the appliances in use. A straightforward method to obtain this information uses a power sensor attached to each household appliance of interest. Unfortunately, this method is costly and requires significant installation and maintenance efforts. A more sophisticated way to obtain appliance-specific data is by disaggregation of total power consumption data acquired at the main breaker level. Such nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) uses a single point of power measurement (e.g., of the electric feed for the whole house), combined with special signal processing techniques.
 
Our paper presents overviews and test results for two novel NIALM approaches we are developing and testing. The first system uses an inexpensive off-the-shelf sensor (TED – The Energy Detective) to obtain real power data at a 1 Hz sampling rate. A statistical algorithm, optimally implementing historical data on power draws and power consumption patterns, has been developed for this system. The algorithm is capable of semi-automatic detection of major household appliances and outperforms the known NIALM algorithms in terms of detection accuracy. The second system relies on a custombuilt sensor capable of sampling voltage and current at a rate of up to 100 kHz. At this sampling rate, voltage and current waveforms and their features are used to identify and track a much broader range of household appliances.},

However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we address both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. This enables us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky \etal on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},

From utility perspective, intrusive data for training are not available due to privacy and the sampling frequency may be too low to recognize meaningful signatures. This paper proposes a 1-hour frequency disaggregation algorithm for real and reactive energy without knowing what appliances are in a specific house/apartment. The proposed algorithm is particularly developed concerning utility's constraints. A database of typical types of appliances in BC, Canada is built. Based on BC Hydro's smart meter data over a year, the most probable appliances in a specific house/apartment are firstly inferred through likelihood maximization and energy consumption matching. The disaggregation is then implemented by an integer multi-objective Genetic Algorithm tuned by appliance dependence rules. The results show that despite of high uncertainty, more than 50% of energy consumption could be disaggregated for random houses/apartments.},

  abstract =     {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is an important topic in smart-grid and smart-home. Many energy disaggregation algorithms have been proposed to detect various individual appliances from one aggregated signal observation. However, few works studied the energy disaggregation of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) charging in the residential environment since EVs charging at home has emerged only recently. Recent studies showed that EV charging has a large impact on smart-grid especially in summer. Therefore, EV charging monitoring has become a more important and urgent missing piece in energy disaggregation. In this paper, we present a novel method to disaggregate EV charging signals from aggregated real power signals. The proposed method can effectively mitigate interference coming from air-conditioner (AC), enabling accurate EV charging detection and energy estimation under the presence of AC power signals. Besides, the proposed algorithm requires no training, demands a light computational load, delivers high estimation accuracy, and works well for data recorded at the low sampling rate 1/60 Hz. When the algorithm is tested on real-world data recorded from 11 houses over about a whole year (total 125 months worth of data), the averaged error in estimating energy consumption of EV charging is 15.7 kwh/month (while the true averaged energy consumption of EV charging is 208.5 kwh/month), and the averaged normalized mean square error in disaggregating EV charging load signals is 0.19.},

However, despite the fact that NALM was proposed over 30 years ago, there are still many open challenges. Indeed, the majority of approaches require training and are sensitive to appliance changes requiring regular re-training. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing a 'blind' NALM approach that does not require any training. The main idea is to build upon an emerging field of graph-based signal processing to perform adaptive threshold-ing, signal clustering and feature matching. Using two datasets of active power measurements with 1min and 8sec resolution, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a state-of-the-art NALM approaches as benchmarks.},

This raises the question of how to integrate both types of models. Methods such as posterior regularization follow the idea of generalized moment matching, in that they allow matching expectations between two models, but sometimes both models are most conveniently expressed as latent variable models. We propose latent Bayesian melding, which is motivated by averaging the distributions over populations statistics of both the individual-level and the population-level models under a logarithmic opinion pool framework. In a case study on electricity disaggregation, which is a type of single-channel blind source separation problem, we show that latent Bayesian melding leads to significantly more accurate predictions than an approach based solely on generalized moment matching.},

  abstract =   {To reduce energy demand in households it is useful to know which electrical appliances are in use at what times. Monitoring individual appliances is costly and intrusive, whereas data on overall household electricity use is more easily obtained. In this paper, we consider the energy disaggregation problem where a household's electricity consumption is disaggregated into the component appliances. The factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM) is a natural model to fit this data. We enhance this generic model by introducing two constraints on the state sequence of the FHMM. The first is to use a non-homogeneous Markov chain, modelling how appliance usage varies over the day, and the other is to enforce that at most one chain changes state at each time step. This yields a new model which we call the interleaved factorial non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (IFNHMM). We evaluated the ability of this model to perform disaggregation in an ultra-low frequency setting, over a data set of 251 English households. In this new setting, the IFNHMM outperforms the FHMM in terms of recovering the energy used by the component appliances, due to that stronger constraints have been imposed on the states of the hidden Markov chains. Interestingly, we find that the variability in model performance across households is significant, underscoring the importance of using larger scale data in the disaggregation problem.},

We introduce a way of incorporating domain knowledge into this problem, called signal aggregate constraints (SACs). SACs encourage the total signal for each of the unknown sources to be close to a specified value. This is based on the observation that the total signal often varies widely across the unknown sources, and we often have a good idea of what total values to expect. We incorporate SACs into an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM) to formulate the energy disaggregation problems where only one mixture signal is assumed to be observed. A convex quadratic program for approximate inference is employed for recovering those source signals. On a real-world energy disaggregation data set, we show that the use of SACs dramatically improves the original AFHMM, and significantly improves over a recent state-of-the art approach.},

Priority Action Plans 3, 9, 10, 11, and 18, with influence from many of the others) in fulfillment of the
EISA 2007 legislation, the European Mandate on Smart Metering (M / 441) (in particular, efforts within
CEN / CENELEC and ETSI, and the Smart Meter Working Group), as well as similar efforts in Australia,
the United Kingdom, Japan, and China, and electric vehicle standardization efforts (in particular, ISO /

One can obtain such information by deploying smart power outlets on every device of interest, however it incurs extra hardware cost and installation complexity. Alternatively, a single sensor can be used to measure total electricity consumption and thereafter disaggregation algorithms can be applied to obtain appliance specific usage information. In such a case, it is quite challenging to discern low-power appliances in the presence of high-power loads. To improve the recognition of low-power appliance states, we propose a solution that makes use of circuit-level power measurements. We examine the use of a specialized variant of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) known as Factorial HMM (FHMM) to recognize appliance specific load patterns from the aggregated power measurements. Further, we demonstrate that feature concatenation can improve the disaggregation performance of the model allowing it to identify device states with an accuracy of 90% for binary and 80% for multi-state appliances. Through experimental evaluations, we show that our solution performs better than the traditional event based approach. In addition, we develop a prototype system that allows real-time monitoring of appliance states.},
