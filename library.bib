  abstract                 = {Changepoints are abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.},

  abstract                 = {We have developed an algorithm to disaggregate short-interval (hourly) whole-building electrical load into major end uses. Hourly load data, hourly load-temperature regression coefficients and simulation end-use results comprise the algorithm input. The algorithm produces hourly load profiles for air conditioning, lighting, fans and pumps, and miscellaneous loads. Measured data from two end-use metered buildings (an office and a retail store) have been used to validate the algorithm. For the retail store, the algorithm estimates of hourly end use compare remarkably well with the monitored end-use data (average error of less than 5% during daytime operation). For the office building, the algorithm gives a consistent bias of about 12 and 27% in overestimating the HVAC and lighting electric loads, respectively, at the expense of underestimating the miscellaenous load by 35%. Results may be attributed to the presence of inconsistencies between office audit information and measured end-use data. A three-fold difference between the auditor's estimate for miscellaneous energy use and the metered amount has been found. The validation, however, indicates great promise for application of the algorithm to whole-building load data for obtaining reliable end-use data.},

  abstract                 = {This paper aims to address two timely energy problems. First, significant low-cost energy reductions can be made in the residential and commercial sectors, but these savings have not been achievable to date. Second, billions of dollars are being spent to install smart meters, yet the energy saving and financial benefits of this infrastructure – without careful consideration of the human element – will not reach its full potential. We believe that we can address these problems by strategically marrying them, using disaggregation. Disaggregation refers to a set of statistical approaches for extracting end-use and/or appliance level data from an aggregate, or whole-building, energy signal. In this paper, we explain how appliance level data affords numerous benefits, and why using the algorithms in conjunction with smart meters is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for getting this data. We review disaggregation algorithms and their requirements, and evaluate the extent to which smart meters can meet those requirements. Research, technology, and policy recommendations are also outlined.},

In this paper, the use of random forest models to detect change points in dynamic systems is considered. The approach is based on the embedding of multivariate time series data associated with normal process conditions, followed by the extraction of features from the resulting lagged trajectory matrix. The features are extracted by recasting the data into a binary classification problem, which can be solved with a random forest model. A proximity matrix can be calculated from the model and from this matrix features can be extracted that represent the trajectory of the system in phase space. The results of the study suggest that the random forest approach may afford distinct advantages over a previously proposed linear equivalent, particularly when complex nonlinear systems need to be monitored.},

Based on collected experimental data, it can identify the parameters of a thermal model of the house. The model obtained will be used to simulate different aspects that can help to reduce the energy consumption. This paper presents a simple solution for thermal modeling of a house which includes experimental identification of the model's parameters. Such data are used to simulate the thermal behavior of the house and to obtain solutions to reduce energy consumption.

The most available solutions separate the whole electric energy consumption based on the measurement of all three voltages and currents. Aside from the cost for special measuring devices, the intrusion into the local installation is the main problem for reaching a high market distribution. The use of standard digital electricity meters could avoid this problem but the loss of information of the measured data has to be compensated by more intelligent algorithms and implemented rules to disaggregate the total load trace of only the active power measurements. The paper presents a NIALM approach to analyse data, collected from a standard digital electricity meter. To disaggregate the consumption of the entire active power into its major electrical end uses, an algorithm consisting of clustering methods, a genetic algorithm and a dynamic programming approach is presented. The genetic algorithm is used to combine frequently occurring events to create hypothetical finite state machines to model detectable appliances. The time series of each finite state machine is optimized using a dynamic programming method similar to the viterbi algorithm.},

They are established tools in a wide range of industrial applications, including search engines, DNA sequencing, stock market analysis, and robot locomotion, and their use is spreading rapidly. People who know the methods have their choice of rewarding jobs. This hands-on text opens these opportunities to computer science students with modest mathematical backgrounds. It is designed for final-year undergraduates and master's students with limited background in linear algebra and calculus. Comprehensive and coherent, it develops everything from basic reasoning to advanced techniques within the framework of graphical models. Students learn more than a menu of techniques, they develop analytical and problem-solving skills that equip them for the real world. Numerous examples and exercises, both computer based and theoretical, are included in every chapter. Resources for students and instructors, including a MATLAB toolbox, are available online.},

  abstract                 = {Smart meter deployments are spurring renewed interest in analysis techniques for electricity usage data. An important prerequisite for data analysis is characterizing and modeling how electrical loads use power. While prior work has made significant progress in deriving insights from electricity data, one issue that limits accuracy is the use of general and often simplistic load models. Prior models often associate a fixed power level with an “on” state and either no power, or some minimal amount, with an “off” state. This paper’s goal is to develop a new methodology for modeling electric loads that is both simple and accurate. Our approach is empirical in nature: we monitor a wide variety of common loads to distill a small number of common usage characteristics, which we leverage to construct accurate load-specific models. We show that our models are significantly more accurate than binary on-off models, decreasing the root mean square error by as much as 8X for representative loads. Finally, we demonstrate two example uses of our models in data analysis: i) generating device-accurate synthetic traces of building electricity usage, and ii) filtering out loads that generate rapid and random power variations in building electricity data},

  abstract                 = {Buildings are one of the largest consumers of electricity. Dominant electricity consumption within the buildings, contributed by plug loads, lighting and air conditioning, can be significantly improved using Occupancy-based Building Management Systems (Ob-BMS). In this paper, we address three critical aspects of Ob-BMS i.e. 1) Modular sensor node design to support diverse deployment scenarios; 2) Building architecture to support and scale fine resolution monitoring; and 3) Detailed analysis of the collected data for smarter actuation. We present key learning across these three aspects evolved over more than one year of design and deployment experiences. The sensor node design evolved over a period of time to address specific deployment requirements. With an opportunity at the host institute where two dorm buildings were getting constructed, we planned for the support infrastructure required for fine resolution monitoring embedded in the design phase and share our preliminary experiences and key learning thereof. Prototype deployment of the sensing system as per the planned support infrastructure was performed at two faculty offices with effective data collection worth 45 days. Collected data is analyzed accounting for efficient switching of appliances, in addition to energy conservation and user comfort as performed in the earlier occupancy based frameworks. Our analysis shows that occupancy prediction using simple heuristic based modeling can achieve similar performance as more complex Hidden Markov Models, thus simplifying the analytic framework.},

We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},

After systematically searching online bibliographic databases, ten relevant articles were located and included in the study. For each article, we analyze the purpose of the study, the content to be taught with the aid of robotics, the type of robot used, the research method used, and the sample characteristics (sample size, age range of students and/or level of education) and the results observed. The articles reviewed suggest that educational robotics usually acts as an element that enhances learning, however, this is not always the case, as there are studies that have reported situations in which there was no improvement in learning. The outcomes of the literature review are discussed in terms of their implications for future research, and can provide useful guidance for educators, practitioners and researchers in the area.},

  abstract                 = {Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python that combines the convenience of NumPy’s syntax with the speed of optimized native machine language. The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPy’s syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and
functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates
them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6× to 7.5× faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the
CPU and between 6.5× and 44× faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.},

This paper documents three kindergarten classrooms' exposure to computer programming concepts and explores learning outcomes. Results point to strengths of the curriculum and areas where further redesign of the curriculum and technologies would be appropriate. Overall, the study demonstrates that kindergartners were both interested in and able to learn many aspects of robotics, programming, and computational thinking with the TangibleK curriculum design.},

  abstract                 = {The energy savings potential within non-domestic buildings from behaviour change initiatives is well known. Energy efficiency measures can contribute to local, national and EU policy commitments on carbon reduction. Yet, research also shows behaviour change is anything but simple. No-where is this more evident that in local government where municipalities are expected to lead on carbon reduction initiatives whilst operating in challenging political landscapes. This paper reflects on a UK Research Council funded case study exploring the role of engagement in a UK municipality. Innovative feedback tools and user-engagement were developed in an effort to foster a collaborative approach to energy management.

Findings from an analysis of a focus group and a set of semi-structured interviews show encouraging signs with regard to increased user-engagement and digital tools, but barriers remain with regards to the ‘real world’ implementation of innovative, and technologically grounded, approaches. These included a staff reduction programme amidst financial cuts, a risk-averse culture with regard to new technologies, and debate about where responsibilities lie with regards to energy management. While these findings were case specific they have implications for organisations contemplating how technology might support them in workplace engagement for reduced energy use.},

The proposed RNN, gated-feedback RNN (GF-RNN), extends the existing approach of stacking multiple recurrent layers by allowing and controlling signals flowing from upper recurrent layers to lower layers using a global gating unit for each pair of layers. The recurrent signals exchanged between layers are gated adaptively based on the previous hidden states and the current input. We evaluated the proposed GF-RNN with different types of recurrent units, such as tanh, long short-term memory and gated recurrent units, on the tasks of character-level language modeling and Python program evaluation. Our empirical evaluation of different RNN units, revealed that in both tasks, the GF-RNN outperforms the conventional approaches to build deep stacked RNNs. We suggest that the improvement arises because the GF-RNN can adaptively assign different layers to different timescales and layer-to-layer interactions (including the top-down ones which are not usually present in a stacked RNN) by learning to gate these interactions.},

  abstract                 = {The brain has an extraordinary capacity for memory storage, but how it stores new information without disrupting previously acquired memories remains unknown. Here we show that different motor learning tasks induce dendritic Ca2+ spikes on different apical tuft branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex. These task-related, branch-specific Ca2+ spikes cause long-lasting potentiation of postsynaptic dendritic spines active at the time of spike generation. When somatostatin-expressing interneurons are inactivated, different motor tasks frequently induce Ca2+ spikes on the same branches. On those branches, spines potentiated during one task are depotentiated when they are active seconds before Ca2+ spikes induced by another task. Concomitantly, increased neuronal activity and performance improvement after learning one task are disrupted when another task is learned. These findings indicate that dendritic-branch-specific generation of Ca2+ spikes is crucial for establishing long-lasting synaptic plasticity, thereby facilitating information storage associated with different learning experiences.},

  abstract                 = {Recognizing lines of unconstrained handwritten text is a challenging task. The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7 percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance.},

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

  abstract                 = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.},

  abstract                 = {Aggregate INDC emissions are far above levels consistent with below
2°C, with around 65% of global emissions covered
INDCs announced by 1 September 2015 lead to global emissions far above the levels
needed by 2025 and 2030 to put the world on track to hold warming below 2°C, or to below
1.5°C, in 2100.
As of 1st September, 29 INDC submissions have been received, reflecting 56 countries
(including the European Union member states), and covering around 65% of global
emissions in 2010 (excluding LULUCF) and 43% of global population. The CAT has directly
assessed 16 of these INDCs covering 64.5% of global emissions in 2010 (excluding LULUCF)
and 41% of global population.
With the INDCs submitted to date, the CAT projects total global emissions are on track to
be 53-57 GtCO2e in 2025 and 55-59 GtCO2e in 2030, far above the least-cost global
pathways consistent with limiting warming below 2°C. Additional reductions in the order of
12-15 GtO2e by 2025 and of 17-21 GtCO2e by 2030 are needed for global emissions to be
consistent with a 2°C pathway.
INDCs are yet to come from 140 countries. The ten highest emitters yet to submit INDCs
are India, Brazil, Iran, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and
Pakistan, together accounting for 18% of global emissions not yet covered by INDCs
(excluding LULUCF).
Aside from the insufficient ambition of the aggregate INDCs, there is a significant gap
between current policies and the INDCs: global emissions under currently implemented
policies are projected to be higher than the already inadequate INDC levels. Some countries
propose INDCs close to the current trajectory giving confidence that they are met (e.g. EU
and China). Others have put forward a target that would be a significant change in trend, but these are not yet supported by any significant existing legislation, e.g. Australia and
Canada, raising questions about the likely implementation. Yet others are showing progress
in policy implementation, continuously moving their future trajectories downwards, but
policies are not yet sufficient to meet their (still inadequate) INDCs (e.g. USA).
The gap between pledges and policies increases through time, highlighting the need for
long-term policy action. This is not to underplay the significance and importance of
governments putting in place policies that will actually reduce their emissions, but for many
governments this is not yet the case.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

To overcome this difficulty, researchers have developed sophisticated optimization techniques and network architectures. In this paper, we propose a simpler solution that use recurrent neural networks composed of rectified linear units. Key to our solution is the use of the identity matrix or its scaled version to initialize the recurrent weight matrix. We find that our solution is comparable to LSTM on our four benchmarks: two toy problems involving long-range temporal structures, a large language modeling problem and a benchmark speech recognition problem.},

For the case of speech data, we show that the learned features correspond to phones/phonemes. In addition, our feature representations trained from unlabeled audio data show very good performance for multiple audio classification tasks.

In order to monitoring the status of each load, a sensor is installed for each load traditionally. The status of the load is transmitted to the main controller such that the status of each load can be monitored. On the other hand, the NILM is able to detect the status of loads by analyzing the current signals that is picked-up by a current sensor installed at the main electrical panel. Traditional NILM methods used real power, reactive power, harmonic contents of power signatures and transient energy to determine the status of appliances. These methods are very complex and require a lot of computation. In this paper, a novel method that integrates artificial intelligent recognition technique and load current acquisition method for NILM is proposed. The proposed method uses timedomain information. This approach is different from traditional NILM methods. The proposed method is able to detect the energization and de-energization of loads by applying back-propagation neural networks (BP-ANNs). The overall correct rate for this method is above 98.75%. This result shows that the proposed method is able to determine the operation status of loads with proper robustness.},

The paper reviews evaluation methods used internationally for both building thermal efficiency and building energy labelling and presents results from two discrete studies in South Australia on monitoring actual household energy consumption. In order to investigate the occupancy effect on household energy, monitored energy data collected from two different housing developments in South Australia were examined. The energy ratings for these homes are compliant with the national agreed protocols for thermal performance modelling of dwellings, where one set of homes is a group occupied by higher socio-economic groups and the other is low income public housing in a colder climate region with much poorer home energy ratings. The wide variation of actual household energy for the homes that have relatively similar thermal envelopes indicates a lack of meaningful use for actual household energy in disclosure of house energy performance.

for training deterministic auto-encoders. We
show that by adding a well chosen penalty
term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those
attained by other regularized auto-encoders

on a range of datasets. This penalty term
corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the
Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations
with respect to the input. We show that
this penalty term results in a localized space
contraction which in turn yields robust features
on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to
both regularized auto-encoders and denoising
auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link
between deterministic and non-deterministic
auto-encoders. We nd empirically that this
penalty helps to carve a representation that
better captures the local directions of variation
dictated by the data, corresponding to a
lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while
being more invariant to the vast majority of
directions orthogonal to the manifold.
Finally, we show that by using the learned
features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state
of the art classication error on a range of
datasets, surpassing other methods of pre-training.},

The depth implicit in the temporally-unrolled form allows the system to exhibit all the power of deep networks, while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters.
From an initially unstructured network the hidden units differentiate into categorical-units, each of which represents an input prototype with a well-defined class; and part-units representing deformations of these prototypes. The learned organization of the recurrent encoder is hierarchical: part-units are driven directly by the input, whereas the activity of categorical-units builds up over time through interactions with the part-units. Even using a small number of hidden units per layer, discriminative recurrent sparse auto-encoders achieve excellent performance on MNIST.},

Demand side energy control also forms an important part in the research programs of many research organisations. Reliable data on energy consumption is therefore imperative for effective research in this field, as well as for the successful implementation of demand side management. Traditional load research instrumentation has involved intrusive techniques that require the installation of sensors on each of the individual components of the total load. A non-intrusive appliance load monitor is proposed in this paper to determine the energy consumption of individual appliances turning on or off or operating under continuously varying load conditions. This monitoring system, which is implemented by network pattern identification technology, is based on detailed analysis of the current and voltage of the total load, as measured at the interface of the power source. The approach has been developed to simplify the collection of energy consumption data by utilities, but also has other applications. It is called nonintrusive to contrast it with previous techniques for gathering appliance data, which require placing sensors on individual appliances, and hence an intrusion onto the energy consumer's property.},

  abstract                 = {Sensing, monitoring and actuating systems are expected to play a key role in reducing buildings overall energy consumption. Leveraging sensor systems to support energy efficiency in buildings poses novel research challenges in monitoring space usage, controlling devices, interfacing with smart energy meters and communicating with the energy grid. In the attempt of reducing electricity consumption in buildings, identifying individual sources of energy consumption is key to generate energy awareness and improve efficiency of available energy resources usage. Previous work studied several non-intrusive load monitoring techniques to classify appliances; however, the literature lacks of an comprehensive system that can be easily installed in existing buildings to empower users profiling, benchmarking and recognizing loads in real-time. This has been a major reason holding back the practice adoption of load monitoring techniques. In this paper we present RECAP: RECognition of electrical Appliances and Profiling in real-time. RECAP uses a single wireless energy monitoring sensor easily clipped to the main electrical unit. The energy monitoring unit transmits energy data wirelessly to a local machine for data processing and storage. The RECAP system consists of three parts: (1) Guiding the user for profiling electrical appliances within premises and generating a database of unique appliance signatures; (2) Using those signatures to train an artificial neural network that is then employed to recognize appliance activities (3) Providing a Load descriptor to allow peer appliance benchmarking. RECAP addresses the need of an integrated and intuitive tool to empower building owners with energy awareness. Enabling real-time appliance recognition is a stepping-stone towards reducing energy consumption and allowing a number of major applications including load-shifting techniques, energy expenditure breakdown per appliance, detection of power hungry and faulty appliances, and recogn- - ition of occupant activity. This paper describes the system design and performance evaluation in domestic environment.},

The SPN outputs a zoomed, rotated and skewed version of the input image. We investigate different down-sampling factors (ratio of pixel in input and output) for the SPN and show that the RNN-SPN model is able to down-sample the input images without deteriorating performance. The down-sampling in RNN-SPN can be thought of as adaptive down-sampling that minimizes the information loss in the regions of interest. We attribute the superior performance of the RNN-SPN to the fact that it can attend to a sequence of regions of interest.},

But at the global level, the correlation between increased wealth and increased energy consumption is very strong and the impact of policies to reduce energy demand is both limited and contested. Different academic disciplines approach energy demand reduction in different ways: emphasising some mechanisms and neglecting others, being more or less optimistic about the potential for reducing energy demand and providing insights that are more or less useful for policymakers. This article provides an overview of the main issues and challenges associated with energy demand reduction, summarises how this challenge is ‘framed’ by key academic disciplines, indicates how these can provide complementary insights for policymakers and argues that a ‘sociotechnical’ perspective can provide a deeper understanding of the nature of this challenge and the processes through which it can be achieved. The article integrates ideas from the natural sciences, economics, psychology, innovation studies and sociology but does not give equal weight to each. It argues that reducing energy demand will prove more difficult than is commonly assumed and current approaches will be insufficient to deliver the transformation required.},

Load recognition for identifying loads being connected and disconnected is applied to a NILM by using a neural network, especially for industrial electrical loads, even though some loads are activated at the nearly same time. In order to accurately decompose the aggregate load into its components, a feature-based model for describing the signatures of individual appliances and load combinations is used. The model will suggest the certain signatures which can be detected for all loads in order to indicate the activities of the separate components. To verify the performance of the model for the features selection, the data sets of the electrical loads and the load recognition techniques apply an electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and a neural network, respectively. The effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition are analyzed and compared by using the back propagation classifier and the learning vector quantization classifier. To obtain a maximum recognition accuracy rate, the calculation of the turn-on transient energy signature employs a window of samples, At, to adaptively segment a transient representative of a class of loads. Experiments performed with a variety of model data sets which reveal the back propagation classifier is superior to the learning quantization classifier in the effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition.},

However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we address both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. This enables us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky \etal on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},
