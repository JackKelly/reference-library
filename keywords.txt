NILM
----
Always also include 'energy'
'simulation' : for things useful for coding better simulator
commercial (NILM articles are assumed to refer to domestic dwellings
unless 'commercial' keyword is present)
circuit-level
harmonics
steady-state
metrics
use cases
water
apportionment (i.e. deciding which individual(s) consumed what energy)

side-channel
------------
EMF

Sample rate keywords
--------------------
'very low freq' (15 minutes or slower)
'low freq' (1 min >= x < 15 mins)
'medium freq' (1Hz >= x < 1min)
'high freq' (faster than  1Hz)

If a specific sample frequency (in Hz) or sample period (in
seconds) is found in the paper then this is put into a
separate biblatex field, e.g. `samplefrequency = {1}` means 1Hz whilst
`sampleperiod = {3600}` means hourly.
