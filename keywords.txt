Always also include 'energy'
'simulation' : for things useful for coding better simulator

unless 'commercial' keyword is present)

--------------------
'very low freq' (15 minutes or slower).  Specific words = hourly, 
'low freq' (1 min >= x < 15 mins)
'medium freq' (1Hz >= x < 1min)
'high freq' (faster than 1Hz)
